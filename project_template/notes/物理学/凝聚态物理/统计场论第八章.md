### 8.1 The nonlinear $\sigma$ model

Previously we considered low-temperature expansions for discrete spins (Ising, Potts, etc.), in which the low energy excitations are droplets of incorrect spin in a uniform background selected by broken symmetry. These excitations occur at small scales, and are easily described by graphs on the lattice. By contrast, for continuous spins, the lowest energy excitations are long-wavelength Goldstone modes, as discussed in Section 2.4. The thermal excitation of these modes destroys the long-range order in dimensions $d \leq 2$. For $d$ close to 2 , the critical temperature must be small, making low-temperature expansions a potential tool for the study of critical phenomena. As we shall demonstrate next, such an approach requires keeping track of the interactions between Goldstone modes.

Consider unit $n$-component spins on the sites of a lattice, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{s}(\mathbf{i})=\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \cdots, s_{n}\right), \quad \text { with } \quad|\vec{s}(\mathbf{i})|^{2}=s_{1}^{2}+\cdots+s_{n}^{2}=1 \tag{8.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

The usual nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\langle\mathbf{i}\rangle} \vec{s}(\mathbf{i}) \cdot \vec{s}(\mathbf{j})=K \sum_{\langle\mathbf{i}\rangle}\left(1-\frac{(\vec{s}(\mathbf{i})-\vec{s}(\mathbf{j}))^{2}}{2}\right) . \tag{8.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

At low temperatures, the fluctuations between neighboring spins are small and the difference in Eq. (8.2) can be replaced by a gradient. Assuming a unit lattice spacing,

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\beta \mathcal{H}=-\beta E_{0}-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \vec{s}(\mathbf{x}))^{2} \tag{8.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the discrete index $\mathbf{i}$ has been replaced by a continuous vector $\mathbf{x} \in \Re^{d}$. A cutoff of $\Lambda \approx \pi$ is thus implicit in Eq. (8.3). Ignoring the ground state energy, the partition function is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D}\left[\vec{s}(\mathbf{x}) \delta\left(s(\mathbf{x})^{2}-1\right)\right] \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\vec{s})^{2}} \tag{8.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

A possible ground state configuration is $\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})=(0, \cdots, 1)$. There are $n-1$ Goldstone modes describing the transverse fluctuations. To examine the effects of these fluctuations close to zero temperature, set

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})=\left(\pi_{1}(\mathbf{x}), \cdots, \pi_{n-1}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma(\mathbf{x})\right) \equiv(\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma(\mathbf{x})) \tag{8.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$ is an $n-1$ component vector. The unit length of the spin fixes $\sigma(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$. For each degree of freedom

$$
\begin{align*}
\int \mathrm{d} \vec{s} \delta\left(s^{2}-1\right) & =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} \vec{\pi} \mathrm{~d} \sigma \delta\left(\pi^{2}+\sigma^{2}-1\right) \\
& =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} \vec{\pi} \mathrm{~d} \sigma \delta\left[\left(\sigma-\sqrt{1-\pi^{2}}\right)\left(\sigma+\sqrt{1-\pi^{2}}\right)\right]  \tag{8.6}\\
& =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d} \vec{\pi}}{2 \sqrt{1-\pi^{2}}},
\end{align*}
$$

where we have used the identity $\delta(a x)=\delta(x) /|a|$. Using this result, the partition function in Eq. (8.4) can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
Z & \propto \int \frac{\mathcal{D} \vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})}{\sqrt{1-\pi(\mathbf{x})^{2}}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}\left[(\nabla \vec{\pi})^{2}+\left(\nabla \sqrt{1-\pi^{2}}\right)^{2}\right]} \\
& =\int \mathcal{D} \vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x}) \exp \left\{-\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x}\left[\frac{K}{2}(\nabla \vec{\pi})^{2}+\frac{K}{2}\left(\nabla \sqrt{1-\pi^{2}}\right)^{2}+\frac{\rho}{2} \ln \left(1-\pi^{2}\right)\right]\right\} . \tag{8.7}
\end{align*}
$$

In going from the lattice to the continuum, we have introduced a density $\rho=N / V=1 / a^{d}$ of lattice points. For unit lattice spacing $\rho=1$, but for the purpose of renormalization we shall keep an arbitrary $\rho$. Whereas the original Hamiltonian was quite simple, the one describing the Goldstone modes $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$ is rather complicated. In selecting a particular ground state, the rotational symmetry was broken. The nonlinear terms in Eq. (8.7) ensure that this symmetry is properly reflected when considering only $\vec{\pi}$.

We can expand the nonlinear terms for the effective Hamiltonian in powers of $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$, resulting in a series

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}[\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})]=\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}+\mathcal{U}_{1}+\mathcal{U}_{2}+\cdots, \tag{8.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}=\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \vec{\pi})^{2} \tag{8.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

describes independent Goldstone modes, while

$$
\begin{equation*}
u_{1}=\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x}\left[\frac{K}{2}(\vec{\pi} \cdot \nabla \vec{\pi})^{2}-\frac{\rho}{2} \pi^{2}\right] \tag{8.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the first order perturbation when the terms in the series are organized according to powers of $T=1 / K$. Since we expect fluctuations $\left\langle\pi^{2}\right\rangle \propto T, \beta \mathcal{H}_{0}$ is

Fig. 8.1 Diagrammatic representation of the two terms in the perturbation $u_{1}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-169.jpg?height=184&width=785&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=719)
order of one, the two terms in $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ are order of $T$; remaining terms are order of $T^{2}$ and higher. In the language of Fourier modes,

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}= & \frac{K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} q^{2}|\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{q})|^{2}, \\
\mathcal{U}_{1}= & -\frac{K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{1} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{2} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{3}}{(2 \pi)^{3 d}} \pi_{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1}\right) \pi_{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}\right) \pi_{\beta}\left(\mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \pi_{\beta}\left(-\mathbf{q}_{1}-\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)\left(\mathbf{q}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \\
& -\frac{\rho}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}|\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{q})|^{2} . \tag{8.11}
\end{align*}
$$

For the non-interacting (quadratic) theory, the correlation functions of the Goldstone modes are

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\pi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) \pi_{\beta}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle_{0}=\frac{\delta_{\alpha \beta}(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{d}\left(\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)}{K q^{2}} \tag{8.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The resulting fluctuations in real space behave as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\pi(\mathbf{x})^{2}\right\rangle_{0} & \left.=\left.\int \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\langle | \vec{\pi}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle_{0}=\frac{(n-1)}{K} \int_{1 / L}^{1 / a} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{q^{2}}  \tag{8.13}\\
& =\frac{(n-1)}{K} \frac{K_{d}\left(a^{2-d}-L^{2-d}\right)}{(d-2)} .
\end{align*}
$$

For $d>2$ the fluctuations are indeed proportional to $T$. However, for $d \leq 2$ they diverge as $L \rightarrow \infty$. This is a consequence of the Mermin-Wagner theorem on the absence of long range order in $d \leq 2$. Polyakov [Phys. Lett. 59B, 79 (1975)] reasoned that this implies a critical temperature $T_{c} \sim \mathcal{O}(d-2)$, and that an RG expansion in powers of $T$ may provide a systematic way to explore critical behavior close to two dimensions.

To construct a perturbative RG, consider a spherical Brillouin zone of radius $\Lambda$, and divide the modes as $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{q})=\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})+\vec{\pi}^{>}(\mathbf{q})$. The modes $\vec{\pi}^{<}$involve momenta $0<|\mathbf{q}|<\Lambda / b$, while we shall integrate over the short wavelength fluctuations $\vec{\pi}^{>}$with momenta in the shell $\Lambda / b<|\mathbf{q}|<\Lambda$. To order of $T$, the coarse-grained Hamiltonian is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\beta \mathcal{H}}\left[\vec{\pi}^{<}\right]=V \delta f_{b}^{0}+\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}\left[\vec{\pi}^{<}\right]+\left\langle\left. u_{1}\left[\vec{\pi}^{<}+\vec{\pi}^{>}\right]\right|_{0} ^{>}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right)\right. \tag{8.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\left\rangle_{0}^{>}\right.$indicates averaging over $\vec{\pi}^{>}$.

The term proportional to $\rho$ in Eq. (8.11) results in two contributions; one is a constant addition to the free energy (from $\left\langle\left(\pi^{>}\right)^{2}\right\rangle$ ), and the other is simply $\rho\left(\pi^{<}\right)^{2}$. (The cross terms proportional to $\vec{\pi}^{<} \cdot \vec{\pi}^{>}$vanish by symmetry.) The quartic part of $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ generates 16 terms as indicated in Fig. 8.3. The contributions on the first and last lines involve either an odd number of $\vec{\pi}^{>}$, and hence vanish by symmetry, or come with either 4 or 0 factors of $\vec{\pi}^{<}$. The former reproduces the quartic interaction, while the latter adds an overall constant. The more interesting contributions arise from products of two $\vec{\pi}^{<}$and two $\vec{\pi}^{>}$ as depicted in the second and third lines, and are of three types. The first type (appearing on the second line) has the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\mathcal{U}_{1}^{a}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}= & 2 \times \frac{-K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{1} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{2} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{3}}{(2 \pi)^{3 d}}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{q}_{3}\right)  \tag{8.15}\\
& \times\left\langle\pi_{\alpha}^{>}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1}\right) \pi_{\alpha}^{>}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}\right)\right\rangle_{0}^{>} \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(-\mathbf{q}_{1}-\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

The integral over the shell momentum $\mathbf{q}_{1}$ is odd and this contribution is zero. (Two similar vanishing terms arise from contractions with different indices

Fig. 8.3 Terms arising from the quartic interaction in first order perturbation theory.
$\alpha$ and $\beta$.) The second term (in the dashed rectangle on the third line) is a renormalization of $\rho$, arising from

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\mathcal{U}_{1}^{b}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}= & -\frac{K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{1} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{2} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{3}}{(2 \pi)^{3 d}}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \\
& \times\left\langle\left.\pi_{\alpha}^{>}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{>}\left(\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)\right|_{0} ^{>} \pi_{\alpha}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(-\mathbf{q}_{1}-\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)\right. \\
= & \frac{K}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda / b} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\left|\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2} \times \int_{\Lambda / b}^{\Lambda} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{k}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{k^{2}}{K k^{2}}  \tag{8.16}\\
= & \frac{\rho}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda / b} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\left|\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2} \times\left(1-b^{-d}\right) .
\end{align*}
$$

(Note that in general $\rho=N / V=\int_{0}^{\Lambda} \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q} /(2 \pi)^{d}$.) Finally, a renormalization of $K$ is obtained from the graph enclosed by the dotted rectangle, as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\mathcal{U}_{1}^{c}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}= & -\frac{K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{1} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{2} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{3}}{(2 \pi)^{3 d}}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \\
& \times\left\langle\pi_{\alpha}^{>}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{>}\left(-\mathbf{q}_{1}-\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)\right\rangle_{0}^{>} \pi_{\alpha}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)  \tag{8.17}\\
= & \frac{K}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda / b} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} q^{2}\left|\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2} \times \frac{I_{d}(b)}{K},
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{d}(b) \equiv \int_{\Lambda / b}^{\Lambda} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{k}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{k^{2}}=\frac{K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2}\left(1-b^{2-d}\right)}{(d-2)} \tag{8.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The coarse-grained Hamiltonian in Eq. (8.14) now equals

$$
\begin{align*}
& \tilde{\beta \mathcal{H}}\left[\vec{\pi}^{<}\right]=V \delta f_{b}^{0}+V \delta f_{b}^{1}+\frac{K}{2}\left(1+\frac{I_{d}(b)}{K}\right) \int_{0}^{\Lambda / b} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} q^{2}\left|\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2} \\
& +\frac{K}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{1} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{2} \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}_{3}}{(2 \pi)^{3 d}} \pi_{\alpha}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{1}\right) \pi_{\alpha}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(\mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \pi_{\beta}^{<}\left(-\mathbf{q}_{1}-\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{3}\right)\left(\mathbf{q}_{1} \cdot \mathbf{q}_{3}\right) \\
& -\frac{\rho}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda / b} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\left|\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2} \times\left[1-\left(1-b^{-d}\right)\right]+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right) . \tag{8.19}
\end{align*}
$$

The most important consequence of coarse graining is the change of the stiffness coefficient $K$ to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{K}=K\left(1+\frac{I_{d}(b)}{K}\right) . \tag{8.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

After rescaling, $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}=\mathbf{x} / b$, and renormalizing, $\vec{\pi}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x})=\vec{\pi}^{<}(\mathbf{x}) / \zeta$, we obtain the renormalized Hamiltonian in real space as

$$
\begin{align*}
-\beta \mathcal{H}^{\prime}= & -V \delta f_{b}^{0}-V \delta f_{b}^{1}-\frac{\tilde{K} b^{d-2} \zeta^{2}}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}^{\prime}\left(\nabla^{\prime} \pi^{\prime}\right)^{2} \\
& -\frac{K b^{d-2} \zeta^{4}}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}^{\prime}\left(\vec{\pi}^{\prime}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \nabla \vec{\pi}^{\prime}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)\right)^{2}+\frac{\rho \zeta^{2}}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \pi^{\prime}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right) \tag{8.21}
\end{align*}
$$

The easiest method for obtaining the rescaling factor $\zeta$ is to take advantage of the rotational symmetry of spins. After averaging over the short wavelength modes, the spin is

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\tilde{\vec{s}}\rangle_{0}^{>} & =\left\langle\left.\left(\pi_{1}^{<}+\pi_{1}^{>}, \cdots, \sqrt{1-\left(\vec{\pi}^{<}+\vec{\pi}^{>}\right)^{2}}\right)\right|_{0} ^{>}\right. \\
& =\left(\pi_{1}^{<}, \cdots, 1-\frac{\left(\vec{\pi}^{<}\right)^{2}}{2}-\left\langle\frac{\left(\vec{\pi}^{>}\right)^{2}}{2}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}+\cdots\right)  \tag{8.22}\\
& =\left(1-\left\langle\frac{\left(\vec{\pi}^{>}\right)^{2}}{2}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right)\right)\left(\pi_{1}^{<}, \cdots, \sqrt{1-\left(\vec{\pi}^{<}\right)^{2}}\right) .
\end{align*}
$$

We thus identify

$$
\begin{equation*}
\zeta=1-\left\langle\frac{(\vec{\pi}>)^{2}}{2}\right\rangle_{0}^{>}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right)=1-\frac{(n-1)}{2} \frac{I_{d}(b)}{K}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right) \tag{8.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

as the length of the coarse-grained spin. The renormalized coupling constant in Eq. (8.21) is now obtained from

$$
\begin{align*}
K^{\prime} & =b^{d-2} \zeta^{2} \tilde{K} \\
& =b^{d-2}\left[1-\frac{n-1}{2 K} I_{d}(b)\right]^{2} K\left[1+\frac{1}{K} I_{d}(b)\right]  \tag{8.24}\\
& =b^{d-2} K\left[1-\frac{n-2}{K} I_{d}(b)+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{K^{2}}\right)\right] .
\end{align*}
$$

For infinitesimal rescaling, $b=(1+\delta \ell)$, the shell integral results in

$$
\begin{equation*}
I_{d}(b)=K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2} \delta \ell . \tag{8.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

The differential recursion relation corresponding to Eq. (8.24) is thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} K}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=(d-2) K-(n-2) K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2} \tag{8.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Alternatively, the scaling of temperature $T=K^{-1}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-\frac{1}{K^{2}} \frac{\mathrm{~d} K}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-(d-2) T+(n-2) K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2} T^{2} . \tag{8.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

It may appear that we should also keep track of the evolution of the coefficients of the two terms in $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ under RG. In fact, spherical symmetry ensures that the coefficient of the quartic term is precisely the same as $K$ at all orders. The apparent difference between the two in Eq. (8.21) is of order of $\mathcal{O}\left(T^{2}\right)$, and will vanish when all terms at this order are included. The coefficient of the second order term in $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ merely tracks the density of points and also has trivial renormalization.

The behavior of temperature under RG changes drastically at $d=2$. For $d<2$, the linear flow is away from zero, indicating that the ordered phase
is unstable and there is no broken symmetry. For $d>2$, small $T$ flows back to zero, indicating that the ordered phase is stable. The flows for $d=2$ are controlled by the second ordered term which changes sign at $n=2$. For $n>2$ the flow is towards high temperatures, indicating that Heisenberg and higher spin models are disordered. The situation for $n=2$ is ambiguous, and it can in fact be shown that $\mathrm{d} T / \mathrm{d} \ell$ is zero to all orders. This special case will be discussed in more detail in the next section. For $d>2$ and $n>2$, there is a phase transition at the fixed point,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T^{*}=\frac{\epsilon}{(n-2) K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2}}=\frac{2 \pi \epsilon}{(n-2)}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right) \tag{8.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\epsilon=d-2$ is used as a small parameter. The recursion relation at order of $\epsilon$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-\epsilon T+\frac{(n-2)}{2 \pi} T^{2} \tag{8.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

Stability of the fixed point is determined by the linearized recursion relation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} \delta T}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}\right|_{T^{*}}=\left[-\epsilon+\frac{(n-2)}{\pi} T^{*}\right] \delta T=[-\epsilon+2 \epsilon] \delta T=\epsilon \delta T, \quad \Longrightarrow \quad y_{t}=\epsilon \tag{8.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

The thermal eigenvalue, and the resulting exponents $\nu=1 / \epsilon$, and $\alpha=2-(2+$ $\epsilon) / \epsilon \approx-2 / \epsilon$, are independent of $n$ at this order.

The magnetic eigenvalue can be obtained by adding a term $-\vec{h} \cdot \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \vec{s}(\mathbf{x})$, to the Hamiltonian. Under the action of RG, $h^{\prime}=b^{d} \zeta h \equiv b^{y_{h}} h$, with

$$
\begin{equation*}
b^{y_{h}}=b^{d}\left[1-\frac{n-1}{2 K} I_{d}(b)\right] . \tag{8.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

For an infinitesimal rescaling

$$
\begin{equation*}
1+y_{h} \delta \ell=(1+d \delta \ell)\left(1-\frac{n-1}{2} T^{*} K_{d} \Lambda^{d-2} \delta \ell\right) \tag{8.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

leading to

$$
\begin{equation*}
y_{h}=d-\frac{n-1}{2(n-2)} \epsilon=1+\frac{n-3}{2(n-2)} \epsilon+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right), \tag{8.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

which does depend on $n$. Using exponent identities, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=2+d-2 y_{h}=\frac{\epsilon}{n-2} . \tag{8.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

The exponent $\eta$ is zero at the lowest order in a $4-d$ expansion, but appears at first order in the vicinity of two dimensions. The actual values of the exponents calculated at this order are not very satisfactory.

### 8.2 Topological defects in the XY model

As stated in the previous section, thermal excitation of Goldstone modes destroys spontaneous order in two-dimensional models with a broken continuous symmetry. The RG study of the nonlinear $\sigma$ model confirms that the
transition temperature of $n$-component spins vanishes as $T^{*}=2 \pi \epsilon /(n-2)$ for $\epsilon=(d-2) \rightarrow 0$. However, the same RG procedure appears to suggest a different behavior for $n=2$. The first indication of unusual behavior for the two-dimensional spin models appeared in an analysis of high-temperature series [H.E. Stanley and T.A. Kaplan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 17, 913 (1966)]. The series results strongly suggested the divergence of susceptibility at a finite temperature, seemingly in contradiction with the absence of symmetry breaking. It was indeed this contradiction that led Wegner to explore the possibility of a phase transition without symmetry breaking [F.J. Wegner, J. Math. Phys. 12, 2259 (1971)]. The $Z_{2}$ lattice gauge theory, discussed in Section 7.5 as the dual of the three-dimensional Ising model, realizes such a possibility. The two phases of the $Z_{2}$ gauge theory are characterized by different functional forms for the decay of an appropriate correlation function (the Wilson loop). We can similarly examine the asymptotic behavior of the spin-spin correlation functions of the XY model at high and low temperatures.

A high-temperature expansion for the correlation function for the XY model on a lattice is constructed from

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\vec{s}_{\mathbf{0}} \cdot \vec{s}_{\mathbf{r}}\right\rangle & =\left\langle\cos \left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{1}{Z} \prod_{i=1}^{N}\left(\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{i}}{2 \pi}\right) \cos \left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right) \mathrm{e}^{K \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \cos \left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{j}\right)} \\
& =\frac{1}{Z} \prod_{i=1}^{N}\left(\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{i}}{2 \pi}\right) \cos \left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right) \prod_{\langle i, j\rangle}\left[1+K \cos \left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{j}\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(K^{2}\right)\right] . \tag{8.35}
\end{align*}
$$

The expansion for the partition function is similar, except for the absence of the factor $\cos \left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)$. To the lowest order in $K$, each bond on the lattice contributes either a factor of one, or $K \cos \left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{j}\right)$. Since,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{1}}{2 \pi} \cos \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right)=0 \tag{8.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

any graph with a single bond emanating from an internal site vanishes. For the numerator of Eq. (8.35) to be non-zero, there must be bonds originating from the external points at $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{r}$. Integrating over an internal point with two bonds leads to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{2}}{2 \pi} \cos \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right) \cos \left(\theta_{2}-\theta_{3}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \cos \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{3}\right) \tag{8.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

The leading graph that contributes to Eq. (8.35) is the shortest path (of length $r$ ) connecting the points $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{r}$. Since integrating over the end points gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{\mathbf{0}} \mathrm{d} \theta_{\mathbf{r}}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \cos \left(\theta_{\mathbf{0}}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \tag{8.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

each bond along the path contributes $(K / 2)$. (In constructing graphs for the partition function, there is an additional factor of 2 for every loop.) Thus to lowest order

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\vec{s}_{\mathbf{0}} \cdot \vec{s}_{\mathbf{r}}\right\rangle \approx\left(\frac{K}{2}\right)^{r}=\mathrm{e}^{-r / \xi}, \quad \text { with } \quad \xi \approx \frac{1}{\ln (2 / K)} \tag{8.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the disordered high-temperature phase is characterized by an exponential decay of correlations. (We have assumed that the path of shortest length is unique. Along a particular direction, the multiplicity of shortest lattice paths typically grows exponentially with $r$, thus modifying the correlation length, but not the exponential decay which is generic to all spin systems.)

At low temperatures, the cost of small fluctuations around the ground state is obtained by a quadratic expansion, which gives $K \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \theta)^{2} / 2$ in the continuum limit. The standard rules of Gaussian integration yield,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\vec{s}_{\mathbf{0}} \cdot \vec{s}_{\mathbf{r}}\right\rangle=\left\langle\mathfrak{R} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)}\right\rangle=\mathfrak{R} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left\langle\left(\theta_{\mathbf{0}}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)^{2}\right\rangle\right] . \tag{8.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

In two dimensions, the Gaussian fluctuations grow as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\left\langle\left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{\mathbf{r}}\right)^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2 \pi K} \ln \left(\frac{r}{a}\right) \tag{8.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a$ is a short distance cutoff (of the order of the lattice spacing). Hence, at low temperatures,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\vec{s}_{0} \cdot \vec{s}_{\mathbf{r}}\right\rangle \approx\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{\frac{1}{2 \pi K}} \tag{8.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

i.e. the decay of correlations is algebraic rather than exponential. A power law decay of correlations implies self-similarity (no correlation length), and is usually associated with a critical point. Here it arises from the logarithmic growth of angular fluctuations, which is specific to two dimensions.

The distinct asymptotic decays of correlations at high and low temperatures allows for the possibility of a finite temperature phase transition separating the two regimes. However, the arguments put forward above are not specific to the XY model. Any continuous spin model will exhibit exponential decay of correlations at high temperature, and a power law decay in a low-temperature Gaussian approximation. To show that the Gaussian behavior persists at finite temperatures, we must prove that it is not modified by the additional terms in the gradient expansion. Quartic terms, such as $\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \theta)^{4}$, generate interactions between the Goldstone modes. The relevance of these interactions was probed in the previous section using the nonlinear $\sigma$ model. The zero temperature fixed point in $d=2$ is unstable for all $n>2$, but apparently stable for $n=2$. (There is only one branch of Goldstone modes for $n=2$. It is the interactions between different branches of these modes for $n>2$ that leads to instability towards high-temperature behavior.) The low-temperature phase of the XY model is said to possess quasi-long range order, as opposed to true long range order that accompanies a finite magnetization.

What is the mechanism for the disordering of the quasi-long range ordered phase? As the RG study suggests that higher order terms in the gradient expansion are not relevant, we must search for other operators. The gradient expansion describes the energy cost of small deformations around the ground state, and applies to configurations that can be continuously deformed to the uniformly ordered state. Kosterlitz and Thouless [J. Phys. C 6, 1181 (1973)] suggested that the disordering is caused by topological defects that can not be regarded as simple deformations of the ground state. Since the angle describing the orientation of a spin is undefined up to an integer multiple of $2 \pi$, it is possible to construct spin configurations for which in going around a closed path the angle rotates by $2 \pi n$. The integer $n$ is the topological charge enclosed by the path. Because of the discrete nature of this charge, it is impossible to continuously deform to the uniformly ordered state in which the charge is zero. (More generally, topological defects arise in any model with a compact group describing the order parameter.)

The elementary defect, or vortex, has unit charge. In completing a circle centered on the defect the orientation of the spin changes by $\pm 2 \pi$. If the radius $r$, of the circle is sufficiently large, the variations in angle will be small and the lattice structure can be ignored. By symmetry, $\nabla \theta$ has a uniform magnitude, and points along the circle (i.e. perpendicular to the radial vector). The magnitude of the distortion is obtained from

$$
\begin{equation*}
\oint \nabla \theta \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{s}=\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{~d} r}(2 \pi r)=2 \pi n, \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta}{\mathrm{~d} r}=\frac{n}{r} . \tag{8.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $\nabla \theta$ is a radial vector, it can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \theta=n\left(-\frac{y}{r^{2}},+\frac{x}{r^{2}}, 0\right)=-\frac{n}{r} \hat{r} \times \hat{z}=-n \nabla \times(\hat{z} \ln r) . \tag{8.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here, $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{z}$ are unit vectors, respectively, in the plane and perpendicular to it, and $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$ indicates the cross product of the two vectors. This (continuum) approximation fails close to the center (core) of the vortex, where the lattice structure is important.

Fig. 8.4 The two elementary vortices in the XY model.

The energy cost of a single vortex of charge $n$ has contributions from the core region, as well as from the relatively uniform distortions away from the center. The distinction between regions inside and outside the core is arbitrary, and, for simplicity, we shall use a circle of radius $a$ to distinguish the two, i.e.

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta \mathcal{E}_{n} & =\beta \mathcal{E}_{n}^{0}(a)+\frac{K}{2} \int_{a} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \theta)^{2} \\
& =\beta \mathcal{E}_{n}^{0}(a)+\frac{K}{2} \int_{a}^{L}(2 \pi r \mathrm{~d} r)\left(\frac{n}{r}\right)^{2}=\beta \mathcal{E}_{n}^{0}(a)+\pi K n^{2} \ln \left(\frac{L}{a}\right) . \tag{8.45}
\end{align*}
$$

The dominant part of the energy comes from the region outside the core, and diverges with the size of the system, $L$. The large energy cost of defects prevents their spontaneous formation close to zero temperature. The partition function for a configuration with a single vortex is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{1}(n) \approx\left(\frac{L}{a}\right)^{2} \exp \left[-\beta \mathcal{E}_{n}^{0}(a)-\pi K n^{2} \ln \left(\frac{L}{a}\right)\right]=y_{n}^{0}(a)\left(\frac{L}{a}\right)^{2-\pi K n^{2}}, \tag{8.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $(L / a)^{2}$ results from the configurational entropy of possible vortex locations in a domain of area $L^{2}$. The entropy and energy of a vortex both grow as $\ln L$, and the free energy is dominated by one or the other. At low temperatures (large $K$ ) energy dominates and $Z_{1}$, a measure of the weight of configurations with a single vortex, vanishes. At high enough temperatures, $K<K_{n}=2 /\left(\pi n^{2}\right)$, the entropy contribution is large enough to favor spontaneous formation of vortices. On increasing temperature, the first vortices to appear correspond to $n= \pm 1$ at $K_{c}=2 / \pi$. Beyond this point there are many vortices in the system, and Eq. (8.46) is no longer useful.

The coupling $K_{c}=2 / \pi$ is a lower bound for the stability of the system to topological defects. This is because pairs (dipoles) of defects may appear at larger couplings. Consider a pair of charges $\pm 1$ at a separation $d$. The distortions far away from the dipole center, $r \gg d$, can be obtained by superposing those of the individual vortices, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \theta=\nabla \theta_{+}+\nabla \theta_{-} \approx \vec{d} \cdot \nabla\left(\frac{\hat{r} \times \hat{z}}{r}\right), \tag{8.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

decays as $d / r^{2}$. Integrating this distortion leads to a finite energy, and hence dipoles appear with the appropriate Boltzmann weight at any temperature. The low-temperature phase should thus be visualized as a gas of tightly bound dipoles. The number (and size) of dipoles increases with temperature, and the high-temperature state is a plasma of unbound vortices. The distinction between the two regimes can be studied by examining a typical net topological charge, $Q(\ell)$, in a large area of dimension $\ell \gg a$. The average charge is always zero, while fluctuations in the low-temperature phase are due to the dipoles straddling the perimeter, i.e. $\left\langle Q(\ell)^{2}\right\rangle \propto \ell$. In the high-temperature state, charges of either sign can appear without restriction and $\left\langle Q(\ell)^{2}\right\rangle \propto \ell^{2}$. (Note the similarity to the
distinct behaviors of the Wilson loop in the high and low temperature phases of the $Z_{2}$ gauge theory.)

To describe the transition between the two regimes, we need to properly account for the interactions between vortices. The distortion field $\vec{u} \equiv \nabla \theta$, in the presence of a collection of vortices, is similar to the velocity of a fluid. In the absence of vorticity, the flow is potential, i.e. $\vec{u}=\vec{u}_{0}=\nabla \phi$, and $\nabla \times \vec{u}_{0}=0$. The topological charge can be related to $\nabla \times \vec{u}$ by noting that for any closed path,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\oint \vec{u} \cdot \mathrm{~d} \vec{s}=\int\left(\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \hat{z}\right) \cdot \nabla \times \vec{u}, \tag{8.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the second integral is over the area enclosed by the path. Since the left-hand side is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$, we can set

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \times \vec{u}=2 \pi \hat{z} \sum_{i} n_{i} \delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right), \tag{8.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

describing a collection of vortices of charge $\left\{n_{i}\right\}$ at locations $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\right\}$. The solution to Eq. (8.49) can be obtained by setting $\vec{u}=\vec{u}_{0}-\nabla \times(\hat{z} \psi)$, leading to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \times \vec{u}=\hat{z} \nabla^{2} \psi, \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \nabla^{2} \psi=2 \pi \sum_{i} n_{i} \delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right) \tag{8.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus $\psi$ behaves like the potential due to a set of charges $\left\{2 \pi n_{i}\right\}$. The solution,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\psi(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i} n_{i} \ln \left(\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right|\right) \tag{8.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

is simply a superposition of the potentials as in Eq. (8.44).
Any two dimensional distortion can thus be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{u}=\vec{u}_{0}+\vec{u}_{1}=\nabla \phi-\nabla \times(\hat{z} \psi) \tag{8.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the corresponding "kinetic energy", $\beta \mathcal{H}=K \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}|\vec{u}|^{2} / 2$, decomposed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}=\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left[(\nabla \phi)^{2}-2 \nabla \phi \cdot \nabla \times(\hat{z} \psi)+(\nabla \times \hat{z} \psi)^{2}\right] \tag{8.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

The second term vanishes, since following an integration by parts,

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \nabla \phi \cdot \nabla \times(\hat{z} \psi)=\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \phi \nabla \cdot(\nabla \times \hat{z} \psi) \tag{8.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $\nabla \cdot \nabla \times \vec{u}=0$ for any vector. The third term in Eq. (8.53) can be simplified by noting that $\nabla \psi=\left(\partial_{x} \psi, \partial_{y} \psi, 0\right)$ and $\nabla \times(\hat{z} \psi)=\left(-\partial_{y} \psi, \partial_{x} \psi, 0\right)$ are orthogonal vectors of equal length. Hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{1} \equiv \frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \times \hat{z} \psi)^{2}=\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \psi)^{2}=-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \psi \nabla^{2} \psi \tag{8.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the second identity follows an integration by parts. Equations (8.50) and (8.51) now result in

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{1} & =-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left(\sum_{i} n_{i} \ln \left(\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right|\right)\right)\left(2 \pi \sum_{j} n_{j} \delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)\right)  \tag{8.56}\\
& =-2 \pi^{2} K \sum_{i, j} n_{i} n_{j} C\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $C(\mathbf{x})=\ln (|\mathbf{x}|) / 2 \pi$ is the two-dimensional Coulomb potential. There is a difficulty with the above result for $i=j$ due to the divergence of the logarithm at small arguments. This is a consequence of the breakdown of the continuum treatment at short distances. The self-interaction of a vortex is simply its core energy $\beta \mathcal{E}_{n}^{0}$, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{1}=\sum_{i} \beta \mathcal{E}_{n_{i}}^{0}-4 \pi^{2} K \sum_{i<j} n_{i} n_{j} C\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right) . \tag{8.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

The configuration space of the XY model close to zero temperature can thus be partitioned into different topological segments. The degrees of freedom in each segment are the charges $\left\{n_{i}\right\}$, and locations $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\right\}$, of the vortices, in addition to the field $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ describing spin waves. The partition function of the model can thus be approximated as

$$
\begin{align*}
Z & =\prod_{i} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~d} \theta_{i}}{2 \pi} \exp \left[K \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \cos \left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{j}\right)\right] \\
& \propto \int \mathcal{D} \phi(\mathbf{x}) \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \phi)^{2}} \sum_{\left\{n_{i}\right\}} \int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x}_{i} \mathrm{e}^{-\sum_{i} \beta \mathcal{E}_{n_{i}}^{0}+4 \pi^{2} K \sum_{i<j} n_{i} n_{j} C\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)}  \tag{8.58}\\
& \equiv Z_{\text {s. } \mathrm{w} .} Z_{Q}
\end{align*}
$$

where $Z_{\text {s.w. }}$ is the Gaussian partition function of spin waves, and $Z_{Q}$ is the contribution of vortices. The latter describes a grand canonical gas of charged particles, interacting via the two dimensional Coulomb interaction. In calculating the Hamiltonian $\beta \mathcal{H}_{1}$ in Eq. (8.55), we performed an integration by parts. The surface integral that was ignored in the process in fact grows with system size as $\left(\sum_{i} n_{i}\right) \ln L$. Thus only configurations that are overall neutral are included in calculating $Z_{Q}$. We further simplify the problem by considering only the elementary excitations with $n_{i}= \pm 1$, which are most likely at low temperatures due to their lower energy. Setting $y_{0} \equiv \exp \left[-\beta \mathcal{E}_{ \pm 1}^{0}\right]$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z_{Q}=\sum_{N=0}^{\infty} y_{0}^{N} \int \prod_{i=1}^{N} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}_{i} \exp \left[4 \pi^{2} K \sum_{i<j} q_{i} q_{j} C\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)\right], \tag{8.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $q_{i}= \pm 1$, and $\sum_{i} q_{i}=0$.

### 8.3 Renormalization group for the Coulomb gas

The two partition functions in Eq. (8.58) are independent and can be calculated separately. As the Gaussian partition function is analytic, any phase transitions of the XY model must originate in the Coulomb gas. As briefly discussed earlier, in the low temperature phase the charges appear only in a small population of tightly bound dipole pairs. The dipoles dissociate in the high temperature phase, forming a plasma. The two phases can be distinguished by examining the interaction between two external test charges at a large separation $X$. In the
absence of any internal charges (for $y_{0}=0$ ) in the medium, the two particles interact by the bare Coulomb interaction $C(X)$. A finite density of internal charges for small $y_{0}$ partially screens the external charges, and reduces the interaction between the test charges to $C(X) / \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is an effective dielectric constant. There is an insulator to metal transition at sufficiently large $y_{0}$. In the metallic (plasma) phase, the external charges are completely screened and their effective interaction decays exponentially.

To quantify this picture, we shall compute the effective interaction between two external charges at $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$, perturbatively in the fugacity $y_{0}$. To lowest order, we need to include configurations with two internal charges (at $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}^{\prime}$ ), and

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{V}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}= & \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)} \\
& \times \frac{\left[1+y_{0}^{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{y} \mathbf{d}^{2} \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)+4 \pi^{2} K\left[C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})-C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)-C\left(\mathbf{y}^{\prime}-\mathbf{x}\right)+C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)\right]}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)\right]}{\left[1+y_{0}^{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{y d} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)\right]}  \tag{8.60}\\
= & \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}\left[1+y_{0}^{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{y} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)}\left(\mathrm{e}^{4 \pi^{2} K D\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime} ; \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)}-1\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)\right],
\end{align*}
$$

where $D\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime} ; \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)$ is the interaction between the internal and external dipoles. The direct interaction between internal charges tends to keep the separation $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{y}^{\prime}-\mathbf{y}$ small. Using the center of mass $\mathbf{R}=\left(\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right) / 2$, we can change variables to $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{r} / 2$ and $\mathbf{y}^{\prime}=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r} / 2$, and expand the dipole-dipole interaction for small $\mathbf{r}$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
D\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime} ; \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right) & =C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R}+\frac{\mathbf{r}}{2}\right)-C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R}-\frac{\mathbf{r}}{2}\right)-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}+\frac{\mathbf{r}}{2}\right)+C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}-\frac{\mathbf{r}}{2}\right) \\
& =-\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}} C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})+\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}} C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(r^{3}\right) . \tag{8.61}
\end{align*}
$$

To the same order

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{e}^{4 \pi^{2} K D\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime}\right)}-1= & -4 \pi^{2} K \mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right) \\
& +8 \pi^{4} K^{2}\left[\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\right]^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(r^{3}\right) \tag{8.62}
\end{align*}
$$

After the change of variables $\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{y d}^{2} \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \rightarrow \int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{R}$, the effective interaction becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{V}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}= & \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}\left\{\left[1+y_{0}^{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{R} \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C(\mathbf{r})}\right.\right. \\
& \times\left(-4 \pi^{2} K \mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\right.  \tag{8.63}\\
& \left.\left.\left.+8 \pi^{4} K^{2}\left[\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\right]^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(r^{3}\right)\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)\right]\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

Following the angular integrations in $\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{r}$, the term linear in $\mathbf{r}$ vanishes, while the angular average of $\left(\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{R}} C\right)^{2}$ is $r^{2}\left|\nabla_{\mathbf{R}} C\right|^{2} / 2$. Hence Eq. (8.63) simplifies to

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{V}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}= & \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)} \\
& \times\left[1+y_{0}^{2} \int(2 \pi r \mathrm{~d} r) \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C(r)} 8 \pi^{4} K^{2} \frac{r^{2}}{2}\right.  \tag{8.64}\\
& \left.\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{R}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(r^{4}\right)\right]
\end{align*}
$$

The remaining integral can be evaluated by parts,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{R}\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{R}}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\right]^{2} \\
= & -\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{R}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\left(\nabla^{2} C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-\nabla^{2} C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)  \tag{8.65}\\
= & -\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{R}\left(C(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-C\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right)\left(\delta^{2}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{R})-\delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}\right)\right) \\
= & 2 C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)-2 C(0) .
\end{align*}
$$

The short distance divergence can again be absorbed into a proper cutoff with $C(x) \rightarrow \ln (x / a) / 2 \pi$, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{V}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}=\mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}\left[1+16 \pi^{5} K^{2} y_{0}^{2} C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \int \mathrm{d} r r^{3} \mathrm{e}^{-2 \pi K \ln (r / a)}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)\right] \tag{8.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

The second order term can be exponentiated to give an effective interaction $\beta \mathcal{V}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \equiv 4 \pi^{2} K_{\text {eff }} C\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)$, with

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{\mathrm{eff}}=K-4 \pi^{3} K^{2} y_{0}^{2} a^{2 \pi K} \int_{a}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} r r^{3-2 \pi K}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right) \tag{8.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

We have thus evaluated the dielectric constant of the medium, $\varepsilon=K / K_{\text {eff }}$, perturbatively to order of $y_{0}^{2}$. However, the perturbative correction is small only as long as the integral in $r$ converges at large $r$. The breakdown of the perturbation theory for $K<K_{c}=2 / \pi$, occurs precisely at the point where the free energy of an isolated vortex changes sign. This breakdown of perturbation theory is reminiscent of that encountered in the Landau-Ginzburg model for $d<4$. Using the experience gained from that problem, we shall reorganize the perturbation series into a renormalization group for the parameters $K$ and $y_{0}$.

To construct an RG for the Coulomb gas, note that the partition function for the system in Eq. (8.59) involves two parameters ( $K, y_{0}$ ), and has an implicit cutoff $a$, related to the minimum separation between vortices. As discussed earlier, the distinction between regions inside and outside the core of a vortex is arbitrary. Increasing the core size to $b a$ modifies not only the core energy, hence $y_{0}$, but also the interaction parameter $K$. The latter is a consequence of the change in the dielectric properties of the medium due to dipoles of separations
between $a$ and $b a$. The change in fugacity is obtained from Eq. (8.46) by changing $a$ to $b a$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{y}_{0}(b a)=b^{2-\pi K} y_{0}(a) \tag{8.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

The modified Coulomb interaction due to dipoles of all sizes is given in Eq. (8.67). (The perturbative calculation at order of $y_{0}^{2}$ incorporates only dipoles.) From dipoles in the size range $a$ to $b a$, we obtain a contribution

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{K}=K\left[1-\left(2 \pi^{2} K\right) \int_{a}^{b a}(2 \pi r \mathrm{~d} r)\left(y_{0}^{2} \mathrm{e}^{-4 \pi^{2} K C(r)}\right) r^{2}\right] \tag{8.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the terms are grouped so as to make the similarity to standard computations of the dielectric constant apparent. (The probability of creating a dipole of size $r$ is multiplied by its polarizability; the role of $\beta=\left(k_{B} T\right)^{-1}$ is played by $2 \pi^{2} K$.)

By choosing an infinitesimal $b=e^{\ell} \approx 1+\ell$, Eq. (8.69) is converted to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} K}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-4 \pi^{3} K^{2} a^{4} y_{0}^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right) \tag{8.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

Including the fugacity, the recursion relations are

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\mathrm{d} K^{-1}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=4 \pi^{3} a^{4} y_{0}^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right)  \tag{8.71}\\
\frac{\mathrm{d} y_{0}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=(2-\pi K) y_{0}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{3}\right)
\end{array}\right.
$$

originally obtained by Kosterlitz [J. Phys. C 7, 1046 (1974)]. While $\mathrm{d} K^{-1} / \mathrm{d} \ell \geq$ 0 , the recursion relation for $y_{0}$ changes sign at $K_{c}^{-1}=\pi / 2$. At smaller values of $K^{-1}$ (high temperatures) $y_{0}$ is relevant, while at lower temperatures it is irrelevant. Thus the RG flows separate the parameter space into two regions. At low temperatures and small $y_{0}$, flows terminate on a fixed line at $y_{0}=0$ and $K_{\text {eff }} \geq 2 / \pi$. This is the insulating phase in which only dipoles of finite size occur. (Hence the vanishing of $y_{0}$ under coarse graining.) The strength of the effective Coulomb interaction is given by the point on the fixed line that the flows terminate on. Flows not terminating on the fixed line asymptote to larger values of $K^{-1}$ and $y_{0}$, where perturbation theory breaks down. This is the signal of the high-temperature phase with an abundance of vortices.

Fig. 8.5 Renormalization group flows of the Coulomb gas system. The line of fixed points at $y_{0}=0$ terminates at $K^{-1}=\pi / 2$ 。

The critical trajectory that separates the two regions of the phase diagram flows to a fixed point at ( $K_{c}^{-1}=\pi / 2, y_{0}=0$ ). To find the critical behavior at the transition, expand the recursion relations in the vicinity of this point by setting $x=K^{-1}-\pi / 2$, and $y=y_{0} a^{2}$. To lowest order, Eqs. (8.71) simplify to

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=4 \pi^{3} y^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(x y^{2}, y^{4}\right)  \tag{8.7}\\
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=\frac{4}{\pi} x y+\mathcal{O}\left(x^{2} y, y^{3}\right)
\end{array}\right.
$$

The recursion relations are inherently nonlinear in the vicinity of the fixed point. This is quite different from the linear recursion relations that we have encountered so far, and the resulting critical behavior is non-standard. First note that Eqs. (8.72) imply

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=8 \pi^{3} y^{2} x=\pi^{4} \frac{\mathrm{~d} y^{2}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}\left(x^{2}-\pi^{4} y^{2}\right)=0, \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^{2}-\pi^{4} y^{2}=c \tag{8.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

The RG flows thus proceed along hyperbolas characterized by different values of $c$. For $c>0$, the focus of the hyperbola is along the $y$-axis, and the flows proceed to $(x, y) \rightarrow \infty$. The hyperbolas with $c<0$ have foci along the $x$ axis, and have two branches in the half plane $y \geq 0$ : the trajectories for $x<0$ flow to the fixed line, while those in the $x>0$ quadrant flow to infinity. The critical trajectory separating flows to zero and infinite $y$ corresponds to $c=0$, i.e. $x_{c}=-\pi^{2} y_{c}$. Therefore, a small but finite fugacity $y_{0}$ reduces the critical temperature to $K_{c}^{-1}=\pi / 2-\pi^{2} y_{0} a^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{2}\right)$.

Fig. 8.6 Detailed views of the RG flows in the vicinity of the termination point of the line of low-temperature fixed points. The dashed line indicates a trajectory of the initial Hamiltonian as the temperature is varied. The phase transition occurs when this trajectory intersects the dotted line.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-183.jpg?height=365&width=676&top_left_y=1347&top_left_x=771)

In terms of the original XY model, the low-temperature phase is characterized by a line of fixed points with $K_{\text {eff }}=\lim _{\ell \rightarrow \infty} K(\ell) \geq 2 / \pi$. There is no correlation length at a fixed point, and indeed the correlations in this phase decay as a power law, $\left\langle\cos \left(\theta_{\mathbf{r}}-\cos \theta_{0}\right)\right\rangle \sim 1 / r^{\eta}$, with $\eta=1 /\left(2 \pi K_{\text {eff }}\right) \leq 1 / 4$. Since the parameter $c$ is negative in the low temperature phase, and vanishes at the critical point, we can set it to $c=-b^{2}\left(T_{c}-T\right)$ close to the transition. In other words, the trajectory of initial points tracks a line $\left(x_{0}(T), y_{0}(T)\right)$. The resulting $c=x_{0}^{2}-\pi^{4} y_{0}^{2} \propto\left(T_{c}-T\right)$ is a linear measure of the vicinity to the
phase transition. Under renormalization, such trajectories flow to a fixed point at $y=0$, and $x=-b \sqrt{T_{c}-T}$. Thus in the vicinity of transition, the effective interaction parameter

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{\text {eff }}=\frac{2}{\pi}-\frac{4}{\pi^{2}} \lim _{\ell \rightarrow \infty} x(\ell)=\frac{2}{\pi}+\frac{4 b}{\pi^{2}} \sqrt{T_{c}-T} \tag{8.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

has a square root singularity.
The stiffness $K_{\text {eff }}$, can be measured in experiments on superfluid films. In the superfluid phase, the order parameter is the condensate wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{x})=\Psi \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \theta}$. Variations in the phase $\theta$ lead to a superfluid kinetic energy,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{H}=\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \psi^{*}\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2} \nabla^{2}}{2 m}\right) \psi=\frac{\hbar^{2} \Psi^{2}}{2 m} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \theta)^{2} \tag{8.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $m$ is the particle (helium 4) mass. The corresponding XY model has a stiffness $K=\hbar^{2} \rho_{s} /\left(2 m^{2} k_{\mathrm{B}} T\right)$, where $\rho_{s}=m \Psi^{2}$ is the superfluid mass density. The density $\rho_{s}$ is measured by examining the changes in the inertia of a torsional oscillator; the superfluid fraction, $m \Psi^{2}$, experiences no friction and does not oscillate. Bishop and Reppy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 40, 1727 (1978)] examined $\rho_{s}$ for a variety of superfluid films of different thickness wrapped around a torsional cylinder. They constructed the effective stiffness $K$ as a function of temperature, and found that for all films it undergoes a universal jump of $2 / \pi$ at the transition. The behavior of $K$ for $T<T_{c}$ was consistent with a square root singularity.

Correlations decay exponentially in the high-temperature phase. How does the correlation length $\xi$ diverge at $T_{c}$ ? The parameter $c=x^{2}-\pi^{4} y^{2}=b^{2}(T-$ $T_{c}$ ) is now positive all along the hyperbolic trajectory. The recursion relation for $x$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=4 \pi^{3} y^{2}=\frac{4}{\pi}\left(x^{2}+b^{2}\left(T-T_{c}\right)\right), \tag{8.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

can be integrated to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{x^{2}+b^{2}\left(T-T_{c}\right)}=\frac{4}{\pi} \mathrm{~d} \ell, \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}} \arctan \left(\frac{x}{b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}}\right)=\frac{4}{\pi} \ell . \tag{8.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

The contribution of the initial point to the left-hand side of the above equation can be left out if $x_{0} \propto\left(T-T_{c}\right) \ll 1$. The integration has to be stopped when $x(\ell) \sim y(\ell) \sim 1$, since the perturbative calculation is no longer valid beyond this point. This occurs for a value of

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ell^{*} \approx \frac{\pi}{4 b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}} \frac{\pi}{2}, \tag{8.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have used $\arctan \left(1 / b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}\right) \approx \arctan (\infty)=\pi / 2$. The resulting correlation length is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\xi \approx a \mathrm{e}^{\ell^{*}} \approx a \exp \left(\frac{\pi^{2}}{8 b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}}\right) \tag{8.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

Unlike any of the transitions encountered so far, the divergence of the correlation length is not through a power law. This is a consequence of the nonlinear nature of the recursion relations in the vicinity of the fixed point.

Vortices occur in bound pairs for distances smaller than $\xi$, while there can be an excess of vortices of one sign or the other at larger separations. The interactions between vortices at large distances can be obtained from the Debye-Hückel theory of polyelectrolytes. According to this theory the free charges screen each other leading to a screened Coulomb interaction, $\exp (-r / \xi) C(r)$. On approaching the transition from the high-temperature side, the singular part of the free energy,

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\text {sing }} \propto \xi^{-2} \propto \exp \left(-\frac{\pi^{2}}{4 b \sqrt{T-T_{c}}}\right) \tag{8.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

has only an essential singularity. All derivatives of this function are finite at $T_{c}$. Thus the predicted heat capacity is quite smooth at the transition. Numerical results based on the RG equations by Berker and Nelson [Phys. Rev. B 19, 2488 (1979)] indicate a smooth maximum in the heat capacity at a temperature higher than $T_{c}$, corresponding to the point at which the majority of dipoles unbind.

The Kosterlitz-Thouless picture of vortex unbinding has found numerous applications in two-dimensional systems such as superconducting and superfluid films, thin liquid crystals, Josephson junction arrays, electrons on the surface of helium films, etc. Perhaps more importantly, the general idea of topological defects has had much impact in understanding the behavior of many systems. The theory of two-dimensional melting developed in the next sections is one such example.

### 8.4 Two-dimensional solids

The transition from a liquid to solid involves the breaking of translational and orientational symmetry. Here we shall examine the types of order that are present in a two-dimensional solid. The destruction of such order upon melting is discussed next.
(a) A low-temperature treatment of the problem starts with the perfect solid at $T=0$. The equilibrium configuration of atoms forms a lattice, $\mathbf{r}_{0}(m, n)=m \mathbf{e}_{1}+n \mathbf{e}_{2}$, where $\mathbf{e}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{e}_{2}$ are basis vectors, and $\{m, n\}$ are integers. At finite temperatures, the atoms fluctuate away from their equilibrium position, moving to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{r}(m, n)=\mathbf{r}_{0}(m, n)+\mathbf{u}(m, n) . \tag{8.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

The low-temperature distortions do not vary substantially over nearby atoms, enabling us to define a coarse-grained distortion field $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{x} \equiv\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ is treated as continuous, with an implicit short distance cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing $a$. The distortion $\mathbf{u}$ is the analog of the angle $\theta$ in the XY model.
(b) Due to translational symmetry, the energy depends only on the strain matrix,

$$
\begin{equation*}
u_{i j}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{i} u_{j}+\partial_{j} u_{i}\right), \quad \Longrightarrow \quad u_{i j}(\mathbf{q})=\frac{\mathrm{i}}{2}\left(q_{i} u_{j}+q_{j} u_{i}\right) \tag{8.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

The elastic energy must respect the symmetries of the underlying lattice. For simplicity, we shall consider the triangular lattice whose elastic energy is fully isotropic, i.e. invariant under all rotations (see Landau and Lifshitz, Theory of Elasticity, Pergamon Press). In terms of the Lamé coefficients $\lambda$ and $\mu$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta \mathcal{H} & =\frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left[2 \mu u_{i j} u_{i j}+\lambda u_{i i} u_{j j}\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}}\left[\mu q^{2} u^{2}+(\mu+\lambda)(\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u})^{2}\right] \tag{8.83}
\end{align*}
$$

The rotational invariance of energy is insured by the implicit sum over the indices $(i, j)$ in the above expression. In the Fourier representation, the energy depends on the quantities $q^{2},|\mathbf{u}|^{2}$, and $(\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u})^{2}$ which are clearly independent of rotations. For other lattices, there are more elastic coefficients, since the energy need only be invariant under the subset of lattice rotations. For example, the symmetry of a square lattice permits a term proportional to $\left(q_{x}^{2} u_{x}^{2}+q_{y}^{2} u_{y}^{2}\right)$.
(c) The Goldstone modes associated with the broken translational symmetry are phonons, the normal modes of vibrations. Equation (8.83) supports two types of normal modes:
(i) Transverse modes with $\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{u}$ have energy

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\beta \mathcal{H}_{T}=\frac{\mu}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} q^{2} u_{T}^{2},\left.\quad \Longrightarrow \quad\langle | u_{T}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\mu q^{2}} \tag{8.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

(ii) Longitudinal modes with $\mathbf{q} \| \mathbf{u}$ have energy

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\beta \mathcal{H}_{L}=\frac{2 \mu+\lambda}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} q^{2} u_{L}^{2},\left.\quad \Longrightarrow \quad| | u_{L}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{(2 \mu+\lambda) q^{2}} \tag{8.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combining the above results, we find that a general correlation function is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle u_{i}(\mathbf{q}) u_{j}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{(2 \pi)^{2} \delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)}{\mu q^{2}}\left[\delta_{i j}-\frac{\mu+\lambda}{2 \mu+\lambda} \frac{q_{i} q_{j}}{q^{2}}\right] \tag{8.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

The extent of fluctuations in position space is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle[\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{0})]^{2}\right\rangle & =\int \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{2-2 \cos (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x})}{\mu q^{2}}\left[\delta_{i i}-\frac{\mu+\lambda}{2 \mu+\lambda} \frac{q_{i} q_{i}}{q^{2}}\right] \\
& =\frac{3 \mu+\lambda}{\mu(2 \mu+\lambda)} \frac{\ln (|\mathbf{x}| / a)}{\pi} . \tag{8.87}
\end{align*}
$$

The unbounded growth of fluctuations with $|\mathbf{x}|$ indicates the destruction of longrange translational order in two dimensions. A similar calculation in higher dimensions results in a finite maximum extent of fluctuations proportional to temperature. The Lindemann criterion identifies the melting point heuristically as the temperature for which these thermal fluctuations reach a fraction (roughly 0.1 ) of the perfect lattice spacing. According to this criterion, the two-dimensional solid melts at any finite temperature. This is of coarse another manifestation of the general absence of true long-range order in two dimensions. Is some form of quasi-long range order, similar to the XY model, possible in this case?
(d) The order parameter describing broken translational symmetry is $\rho_{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{x})=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{r}(\mathbf{x})}$, where $\mathbf{G}$ is any reciprocal lattice vector. Since $\mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}$ is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ by definition, $\rho_{\mathbf{G}}=1$ at zero temperature. Due to fluctuations $\left\langle\rho_{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{x})\right\rangle=\left\langle\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})}\right\rangle$ decreases at finite temperatures, and its correlations decay as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\rho_{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{x}) \rho_{\mathbf{G}}^{*}(\mathbf{0})\right\rangle & =\left\langle\mathrm{e}^{i \mathbf{G} \cdot(\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{0}))}\right\rangle \\
& =\exp \left(-\frac{G_{\alpha} G_{\beta}}{2}\left\langle\left(u_{\alpha}(\mathbf{x})-u_{\alpha}(\mathbf{0})\right)\left(u_{\beta}(\mathbf{x})-u_{\beta}(\mathbf{0})\right)\right\rangle\right) \\
& =\exp \left\{-\frac{G_{\alpha} G_{\beta}}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}^{\prime}}{(2 \pi)^{2}}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}-1\right)\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{x}}-1\right)\left\langle u_{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) u_{\beta}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right)\right\} \\
& =\exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{2-2 \cos \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{q^{2}}\left(\frac{G^{2}}{\mu}-\frac{\mu+\lambda}{\mu(2 \mu+\lambda)} \frac{(\mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{q})^{2}}{q^{2}}\right)\right\} \\
& \approx \exp \left\{-\frac{G^{2}(3 \mu+\lambda)}{2 \mu(2 \mu+\lambda)} \frac{\ln (|\mathbf{x}| / a)}{2 \pi}\right\}=\left(\frac{a}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right)^{\eta_{G}} . \tag{8.88}
\end{align*}
$$

The integration over $\mathbf{q}$ is performed after replacing $(\mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{q})^{2}$ with the angular average of $G^{2} q^{2} / 2$. This is not strictly correct because of the presence of the term $\cos \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}$ which breaks the rotational symmetry. Nevertheless, this approximation captures the correct asymptotic growth of the integral. Correlations thus decay algebraically with an exponent

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{G}=\frac{G^{2}(3 \mu+\lambda)}{4 \pi \mu(2 \mu+\lambda)} \tag{8.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

The translational correlations are measured in diffraction experiments. The scattering amplitude is the Fourier transform of $\rho_{\mathbf{q}}$, and the scattered intensity at a wavevector $\mathbf{q}$ is proportional to the structure factor

$$
\begin{align*}
S(\mathbf{q}) & \left.\left.=\left.\langle | A(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle=\left.\langle | \sum_{m, n} \mathrm{e}^{\mathbf{i q} \cdot \mathbf{r}(m, n)}\right|^{2}\right\rangle=N \sum_{m, n}\left\langle\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot(\mathbf{r}(m, n)-\mathbf{r}(0,0))}\right\rangle  \tag{8.90}\\
& =N \sum_{m, n} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot\left(\mathbf{r}_{0}(m, n)-\mathbf{r}_{0}(0,0)\right)}\left\langle\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot(\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{0})}\right\rangle
\end{align*}
$$

where $N$ is the total number of particles. At zero temperature, the structure factor is a set of delta-functions (Bragg peaks) at the reciprocal lattice vectors. Even at
finite temperature the sum is zero due to varying phases, unless $\mathbf{q}$ is in the vicinity of a lattice vector $\mathbf{G}$. We can then replace the sum with an integral, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
S(\mathbf{q} \approx \mathbf{G}) \approx N \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x e}^{\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{G}) \cdot \mathbf{x}}\left(\frac{a}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right)^{\eta_{\mathbf{G}}} \approx \frac{N}{|\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{G}|^{2-\eta_{\mathbf{G}}}} \tag{8.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

The Bragg peaks are now replaced by power law singularities. The strength of the divergence decreases with temperature and increasing $|\mathbf{G}|$. The peaks corresponding to sufficiently large $|\mathbf{G}|$ are no longer visible, and gradually more of them disappear on increasing temperature. In three dimensions, the structure factor is still a set of delta-functions, but with magnitudes diminished by the so called Debye-Waller factor of $\exp \left(-\frac{G^{2}}{12 \pi a} \frac{5 \mu+2 \lambda}{\mu(2 \mu+\lambda)}\right)$.
(e) The crystal phase is also characterized by a broken rotational symmetry. We can define an orientational order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\mathrm{e}^{6 \mathrm{ii}(\mathbf{x})}$, where $\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is the angle between local lattice bonds and a reference axis. (The factor of 6 results from the equivalence of the six possible directions on the triangular lattice. The appropriate choice for a square lattice is $\mathrm{e}^{4 i \theta(\mathbf{x})}$.) The order parameter has unit magnitude at $T=0$, and is expected to decrease due to fluctuations at finite temperature. The distortion $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})$ leads to a change in bond angle given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_{y}}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u_{x}}{\partial y}\right)=-\frac{1}{2} \hat{z} \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf{u} . \tag{8.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

The decay of orientational fluctuations is now calculated from

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle\Psi(\mathbf{x}) \Psi^{*}(0)\right\rangle & =\left\langle\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}(\theta(\theta(\mathbf{x})-\theta(\mathbf{0}))}\right\rangle \\
& =\exp \left[-\frac{6^{2}}{2} \frac{1}{4}\left\langle[\nabla \times \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})-\nabla \times \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{0})]^{2}\right\rangle\right] \\
& =\exp \left\{-\frac{9}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q} \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}^{\prime}}{(2 \pi)^{4}}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}-1\right)\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{x}}-1\right) \varepsilon_{i j k} \varepsilon_{i j^{\prime} k^{\prime}} q_{j} q_{j^{\prime}}^{\prime}\left\langle u_{k}(\mathbf{q}) u_{k^{\prime}}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\right\} \\
& \left.=\exp \left\{-\frac{9}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}}(2-2 \cos \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x})\left(\left.q^{2}\langle | u(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle-\left\langle(\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u})^{2}\right\rangle\right)\right\} \\
& =\exp \left\{-\frac{9}{2 \mu} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}}(2-2 \cos \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x})\right\} \approx \exp \left(-\frac{9}{a^{2} \mu}\right) \tag{8.93}
\end{align*}
$$

(Note that $\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{q} /(2 \pi)^{2}$ is the density $n=N / L^{2}=1 / a^{2}$.) The final result is independent of $\mathbf{x}$ at large distances, and asymptotes to a constant that decays exponentially with temperature (since $\mu \propto 1 / T$ ). The two-dimensional solid is thus characterized by quasi-long range translational order, and true long range orientational order.

### 8.5 Two-dimensional melting

There are qualitative similarities between the melting of a two-dimensional solid and the disordering of the XY spin system. Expanding on the work of Kosterlitz and Thouless [J. Phys. C 5, L124 (1972)], Halperin and Nelson [Phys. Rev. Lett. 41, 121 (1978)], and independently, Young [Phys. Rev. B 19,

Fig. 8.7 Examples of dislocations, and the corresponding Burger's vectors, on the triangular and square lattices.

1855 (1978)], developed a theory of two-dimensional melting. The resulting, so-called KTHNY theory is briefly sketched here.
(a) The topological defects of a solid are dislocations. A single dislocation corresponds to an extra half lattice plane, and is characterized by performing a Burger's circuit: The circuit is a series of steps from site to site that on a perfect lattice returns to the starting point (e.g. five steps to the right, four down, followed by five left, and four up on a square lattice.) If the circuit encloses a region with dislocations, it will fail to close. The difference between the initial and final sites of the circuit defines b, the Burger's vector of the dislocation. This closure failure is possible since the distortion field $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})$ is defined only up to a lattice vector. In terms of the continuous distortion field this closure failure is described by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\oint \nabla u_{\alpha} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}=b^{\alpha} . \tag{8.94}

Thus each component of the distortion field behaves like the angle $\theta(\mathbf{x})$ in the XY model. Using this analogy, a possible distortion field due to a collection of dislocations $\left\{\mathbf{b}_{i}\right\}$, at locations $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\right\}$, has a singular part

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \tilde{u}_{\alpha}^{*}=-\nabla \times\left(\hat{z} \sum_{i} \frac{b_{i}^{\alpha}}{2 \pi} \ln \left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right|\right) \tag{8.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

While the above $\tilde{u}_{\alpha}^{*}$ correctly describes the singularities due to the presence of dislocations, it is not a local equilibrium configuration, i.e. not a solution to $2 \mu \tilde{u}_{\alpha \beta}+\lambda \delta_{\alpha \beta} \tilde{u}_{\gamma \gamma}=0$. Allowing the particles to equilibrate in the presence of the dislocations leads to a solution $\tilde{u}_{\alpha}$, which differs from $\tilde{u}_{\alpha}^{*}$ only by a regular part. The total strain field can now decomposed as $u_{\alpha \beta}=\phi_{\alpha \beta}+\tilde{u}_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\tilde{u}_{\alpha \beta}$ results from dislocations, and $\phi_{\alpha \beta}$ is the contribution of phonons. After substituting this form in the elastic energy $\beta \mathcal{H}=\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left[2 \mu u_{\alpha \beta} u_{\alpha \beta}+\lambda u_{\alpha \alpha} u_{\beta \beta}\right] / 2$, manipulations similar to the XY model lead to $\beta \mathcal{H}=\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}+\beta \mathcal{H}_{1}$, where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}=\frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left[2 \mu \phi_{\alpha \beta} \phi_{\alpha \beta}+\lambda \phi_{\alpha \alpha} \phi_{\beta \beta}\right] \tag{8.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{1}=-\bar{K} \sum_{i<j} b_{i}^{\alpha} b_{j}^{\beta} C_{\alpha \beta}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)-\sum_{i} \ln \left[y_{0}\left(\mathbf{b}_{i}\right)\right] \tag{8.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

The dislocations behave as a grand canonical gas of particles with vector charges $\left\{\mathbf{b}_{i}\right\}$. The fugacity $y_{0}$ comes from the core energy of each dislocation. These charges interact via a vectorial generalization of the Coulomb interaction,

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2 \pi}\left[\delta_{\alpha \beta} \ln \left(\frac{|\mathbf{x}|}{a}\right)-\frac{x_{\alpha} x_{\beta}}{x^{2}}\right] \tag{8.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

The strength of the interaction in Eq. (8.97) is $\bar{K} a^{2}=2 \mu(\mu+\lambda) /(2 \mu+\lambda)$. Implicit in the above derivation is an overall neutrality condition, $\sum_{i} \mathbf{b}_{i}=\mathbf{0}$.

The bare interaction between dislocations is screened by other dislocations in the medium. As in the case of vortices, an effective strength can be calculated perturbatively in $y_{0}$. The perturbative correction, however, diverges for $\pi \bar{K} a^{2}<2$, signaling the unbinding of paired neutral dislocations. Under coarse graining, the parameters of the theory evolve as

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\mathrm{d} \bar{K}^{-1}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=A y^{2}+B y^{3}  \tag{8.99}\\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y_{0}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=(2-\pi \bar{K}) y+D y^{2}
\end{array}\right.
$$

where $A, B$, and $D$ are constants. In contrast to the XY model, additional terms appear at order of $y_{0}^{3}$. This is because in a scalar Coulomb gas the only neutral configurations have an even number of particles. For dislocations on a triangular lattice, it is possible to construct a neutral configuration from three dislocations at $120^{\circ}$ angles.

The low-temperature phase maps onto a line of fixed points characterized by renormalized Lamé coefficients, $\mu_{R}$ and $\lambda_{R}$, and $y_{0}^{*}=0$. At high temperatures $y_{0}$ and $\bar{K}$ both diverge, indicating the vanishing of the shear modulus $\mu_{R}$, and a finite correlation length $\xi$. On approaching the transition from the low-temperature side, the effective shear modulus undergoes a discontinuous jump, with a singular behavior, $\mu_{R} \simeq \mu_{c}+c\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{\bar{\nu}}$. The correlation length diverges from the hightemperature side as $\xi \simeq a \exp \left(c^{\prime} /\left(T-T_{c}\right)^{\bar{\nu}}\right)$. Due to the cubic terms appearing in Eqs. (8.99), the value of $\bar{\nu}=0.36963 \cdots$ is different from the $1 / 2$ that appears in the XY model, indicating a difference between transitions in vector and scalar Coulomb universality classes [Nelson and Halperin, Phys. Rev. B 19, 2457 (1979)].
(b) Does the vanishing of the shear modulus imply that the high temperature phase with unbound dislocations is a liquid? As discussed earlier, the crystalline phase has both translational and orientational order. A distortion $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})$ results in a rotation in bond angles according to Eq. (8.92). The net rotation due to a collection of dislocations is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{2} \hat{z} \cdot \nabla \times \tilde{u}=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_{i} \frac{\mathbf{b}_{i} \cdot\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right|^{2}} \tag{8.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

In terms of a continuum dislocation density $\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i} \mathbf{b}_{i} \delta^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \frac{\mathbf{b}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \cdot\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right|^{2}} \tag{8.101}
\end{equation*}
$$

Alternatively, in Fourier space,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{q})=\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x d}^{2} \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}} \frac{b\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right) \cdot\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)}{2 \pi\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right|^{2}}=\mathrm{i} \frac{\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{q}) \cdot \mathbf{q}}{q^{2}} \tag{8.102}
\end{equation*}
$$

The angular fluctuations are thus related to correlations in dislocation density via

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\left.\langle | \tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{q_{\alpha} q_{\beta}}{q^{4}}\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{q})\right\rangle \tag{8.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{q})\right\rangle=\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{x}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{0})\right\rangle \tag{8.104}
\end{equation*}
$$

After the dislocations are unbound for $T>T_{c}$, they interact via a screened Coulomb interaction, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim _{|\mathbf{x}| \rightarrow \infty}\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{x}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{0})\right\rangle \propto \delta_{\alpha \beta} e^{-|\mathbf{x}| / \xi}, \Longrightarrow \lim _{\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}}\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{q})\right\rangle \propto \delta_{\alpha \beta} \xi^{2} \tag{8.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting into Eq. (8.103) leads to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\left.\lim _{\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}}\langle | \tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle \propto \frac{\xi^{2}}{q^{2}} \tag{8.106}
\end{equation*}
$$

(In the low-temperature phase, the neutrality of the charges at a large scale $|\mathbf{q}|^{-1}$ requires the vanishing of $\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{q})$ as $\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}$, and $\lim _{\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}}\left\langle b^{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) b^{\beta}(\mathbf{q})\right\rangle \propto q_{\alpha} q_{\beta}$, leading to a finite $\left.\left.\langle | \tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{q})\right|^{2}\right\rangle$.)

Equation (8.106) implies that after the unbinding of dislocations the orientational fluctuations are still correlated. In fact such correlations would result from a Hamiltonian

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \mathcal{H}=\frac{K_{A}}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla \theta)^{2}, \quad \text { with } \quad K_{A} \propto \xi^{2} \tag{8.107}
\end{equation*}
$$

The angular stiffness $K_{A}$ is known as the Frank constant. The bond angle order correlations now decay as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\Psi(\mathbf{x}) \Psi^{*}(\mathbf{0})\right\rangle=\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{36}{2}\left\langle[\tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{x})-\tilde{\theta}(\mathbf{0})]^{2}\right\rangle}=\left(\frac{a}{|\mathbf{x}|}\right)^{-\eta_{\Psi}} \tag{8.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $\eta_{\Psi}=18 /\left(\pi K_{A}\right)$. The quasi-long range decay of orientational fluctuations leads to the appearance of a six-fold intensity modulation in the diffraction pattern. The dislocations are thus not effective in completely destroying order, and their unbinding leads to the appearance of an orientationally ordered phase known as a hexatic. The stiffness of the hexatic phase diverges at the transition to a solid according to Eq. (8.107).
(c) Orientational order disappears at a higher temperature due to the unbinding of a new set of topological defects known as disclinations. These are very similar to the vortices in the XY model, except that since the bond angle is defined only up to $2 \pi / 6$, they satisfy

$$
\begin{equation*}
\oint \nabla \theta \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{s}=\frac{2 \pi}{6} . \tag{8.109}
\end{equation*}
$$

The energy cost of a disclination grows with system size as $\mathcal{E}_{1}=\pi K_{A} \ln (L / a) / 36$. Considering the entropy of $2 \ln (L / a)$, we find a disclination unbinding transition for $K_{A}<72 / \pi$. This transition is in the universality class of the scalar Coulomb gas. The resulting high-temperature phase has neither orientational nor translational order and is a conventional liquid.

Fig. 8.8 Two-stage melting of a two-dimensional triangular lattice: The orientational correlation length $\xi_{o}$ diverges at the liquid to hexatic transition at $T_{1}$. The hexatic stiffness $K$ diverges at the hexatic to solid transition at $T_{2}$. The elastic shear coefficient has a jump at $T_{1}$.

This scenario predicts that the melting of a two-dimensional solid proceeds through an intermediate hexatic phase. In fact, computer simulations suggest that simple two-dimensional solids, e.g. particles interacting via Lennard-Jones potentials, undergo a direct first order melting transition as in three dimensions. More complicated molecular systems in three dimensions, e.g. long polymers, are known to have intermediate liquid crystal phases. Liquid crystals have order intermediate between solid and fluid and are three-dimensional analogs of the hexatic phase. Thin films made up of a few monolayers of liquid crystals are good candidates for examining the KTHNY melting scenario.

## Problems for chapter 8

1. Anisotropic nonlinear $\sigma$ model: Consider unit $n$-component spins, $\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})=$ $\left(s_{1}, \cdots, s_{n}\right)$ with $\sum_{\alpha} s_{\alpha}^{2}=1$, subject to a Hamiltonian

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}=\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x}\left[\frac{1}{2 T}(\nabla \vec{s})^{2}+g s_{1}^{2}\right] .
$$

For $g=0$, renormalization group equations are obtained through rescaling distances by a factor $b=e^{\ell}$, and spins by a factor $\zeta=b^{y_{s}}$ with $y_{s}=-\frac{(n-1)}{4 \pi} T$, and lead to the flow equation

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-\epsilon T+\frac{(n-2)}{2 \pi} T^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(T^{3}\right)
$$

where $\epsilon=d-2$.
(a) Find the fixed point, and the thermal eigenvalue $y_{T}$.
(b) Write the renormalization group equation for $g$ in the vicinity of the above fixed point, and obtain the corresponding eigenvalue $y_{g}$.
(c) Sketch the phase diagram as a function of $T$ and $g$, indicating the phases, and paying careful attention to the shape of the phase boundary as $g \rightarrow 0$.

2. Matrix models: In some situations, the order parameter is a matrix rather than a vector. For example, in triangular (Heisenberg) antiferromagnets each triplet of spins aligns at $120^{\circ}$, locally defining a plane. The variations of this plane across the system are described by a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix. We can construct a nonlinear $\sigma$ model to describe a generalization of this problem as follows. Consider the Hamiltonian

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}=\frac{K}{4} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \operatorname{tr}\left[\nabla M(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \nabla M^{T}(\mathbf{x})\right]
$$

where $M$ is a real, $N \times N$ orthogonal matrix, and "tr" denotes the trace operation. The condition of orthogonality is that $M M^{T}=M^{T} M=I$, where $I$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix, and $M^{T}$ is the transposed matrix, $M_{i j}^{T}=M_{j i}$. The partition function is obtained by summing over all matrix functionals, as

$$
Z=\int \mathcal{D} M(\mathbf{x}) \delta\left(M(\mathbf{x}) M^{T}(\mathbf{x})-I\right) \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}[M(\mathbf{x})]}
$$

(a) Rewrite the Hamiltonian and the orthogonality constraint in terms of the matrix elements $M_{i j}(i, j=1, \cdots, N)$. Describe the ground state of the system.
(b) Define the symmetric and anti-symmetric matrices

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
\sigma & =\frac{1}{2}\left(M+M^{T}\right)=\sigma^{T} \\
\pi & =\frac{1}{2}\left(M-M^{T}\right)=-\pi^{T}
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

Express $\beta \mathcal{H}$ and the orthogonality constraint in terms of the matrices $\sigma$ and $\pi$.
(c) Consider small fluctuations about the ordered state $M(\mathbf{x})=I$. Show that $\sigma$ can be expanded in powers of $\pi$ as

$$
\sigma=I-\frac{1}{2} \pi \pi^{T}+\cdots
$$

Use the orthogonality constraint to integrate out $\sigma$, and obtain an expression for $\beta H$ to fourth order in $\pi$. Note that there are two distinct types of fourth order terms. Do not include terms generated by the argument of the delta function. As shown for the nonlinear $\sigma$ model in the text, these terms do not affect the results at lowest order.
(d) For an $N$-vector order parameter there are $N-1$ Goldstone modes. Show that an orthogonal $N \times N$ order parameter leads to $N(N-1) / 2$ such modes.
(e) Consider the quadratic piece of $\beta \mathcal{H}$. Show that the two point correlation function in Fourier space is

$$
\left\langle\pi_{i j}(\mathbf{q}) \pi_{k l}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{d}\left(\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)}{K q^{2}}\left[\delta_{i k} \delta_{j l}-\delta_{i l} \delta_{j k}\right]
$$

We shall now construct a renormalization group by removing Fourier modes $M^{>}(\mathbf{q})$, with $\mathbf{q}$ in the shell $\Lambda / b<|\mathbf{q}|<\Lambda$.
(f) Calculate the coarse grained expectation value for $\langle\operatorname{tr}(\sigma)\rangle_{0}$ at low temperatures after removing these modes. Identify the scaling factor, $M^{\prime}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)=M^{<}(\mathbf{x}) / \zeta$, that restores $\operatorname{tr}\left(M^{\prime}\right)=\operatorname{tr}\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)=N$.
(g) Use perturbation theory to calculate the coarse grained coupling constant $\tilde{K}$. Evaluate only the two diagrams that directly renormalize the $\left(\nabla \pi_{i j}\right)^{2}$ term in $\beta \mathcal{H}$, and show that

$$
\tilde{K}=K+\frac{N}{2} \int_{\Lambda / b}^{\Lambda} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{q^{2}} .
$$

(h) Using the result from part (f), show that after matrix rescaling, the RG equation for $K^{\prime}$ is given by:

$$
K^{\prime}=b^{d-2}\left[K-\frac{N-2}{2} \int_{\Lambda / b}^{\Lambda} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{q^{2}}\right] .
$$

(i) Obtain the differential RG equation for $T=1 / K$, by considering $b=1+\delta \ell$. Sketch the flows for $d<2$ and $d=2$. For $d=2+\epsilon$, compute $T_{c}$ and the critical exponent $\nu$.
(j) Consider a small symmetry breaking term $-h \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \operatorname{tr}(M)$, added to the Hamiltonian. Find the renormalization of $h$, and identify the corresponding exponent $y_{h}$.

Combining RG and symmetry arguments, it can be shown that the $3 \times 3$ matrix model is perturbatively equivalent to the $N=4$ vector model at all orders. This would suggest that stacked triangular antiferromagnets provide a realization of the $\mathcal{O}(4)$ universality class; see P. Azaria, B. Delamotte, and T. Jolicoeur, J. Appl. Phys. 69, 6170 (1991). However, non-perturbative (topological) aspects appear to remove this equivalence as discussed in S.V. Isakov, T. Senthil, Y.B. Kim, Phys. Rev. B 72, 174417 (2005).

3. The roughening transition: In an earlier problem we examined a continuum interface model which in $d=3$ is described by the Hamiltonian

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}=-\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x}(\nabla h)^{2},
$$

where $h(\mathbf{x})$ is the interface height at location $\mathbf{x}$. For a crystalline facet, the allowed values of $h$ are multiples of the lattice spacing. In the continuum, this tendency for integer $h$ can be mimicked by adding a term

$$
-\beta U=y_{0} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \cos (2 \pi h)
$$

to the Hamiltonian. Treat $-\beta U$ as a perturbation, and proceed to construct a renormalization group as follows:
(a) Show that

$$
\left\langle\exp \left[\mathrm{i} \sum_{\alpha} q_{\alpha} h\left(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\right)\right]\right\rangle_{0}=\exp \left[\frac{1}{K} \sum_{\alpha<\beta} q_{\alpha} q_{\beta} C\left(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}-\mathbf{x}_{\beta}\right)\right]
$$

for $\sum_{\alpha} q_{\alpha}=0$, and zero otherwise. $(C(\mathbf{x})=\ln |\mathbf{x}| / 2 \pi$ is the Coulomb interaction in two dimensions.)
(b) Prove that

$$
\left.\langle | h(\mathbf{x})-\left.h(\mathbf{y})\right|^{2}\right\rangle=-\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{~d} k^{2}} G_{k}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\right|_{k=0},
$$

where $G_{k}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})=\langle\exp [\mathrm{i} k(h(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{y}))]\rangle$.
(c) Use the results in (a) to calculate $G_{k}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})$ in perturbation theory to order of $y_{0}^{2}$. (Hint: Set $\cos (2 \pi h)=\left(\mathrm{e}^{2 \mathrm{i} \pi h}+\mathrm{e}^{-2 \mathrm{i} \pi h}\right) / 2$. The first order terms vanish according to the result in (a), while the second order contribution is identical in structure to that of the Coulomb gas described in this chapter.)
(d) Write the perturbation result in terms of an effective interaction $K$, and show that perturbation theory fails for $K$ larger than a critical $K_{c}$.
(e) Recast the perturbation result in part (d) into renormalization group equations for $K$ and $y_{0}$, by changing the "lattice spacing" from $a$ to $a \mathrm{e}^{\ell}$.
(f) Using the recursion relations, discuss the phase diagram and phases of this model.
(g) For large separations $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|$, find the magnitude of the discontinuous jump in $\left.\langle | h(\mathbf{x})-\left.h(\mathbf{y})\right|^{2}\right\rangle$ at the transition.

4. Roughening and duality: Consider a discretized version of the Hamiltonian in the previous problem, in which for each site $i$ of a square lattice there is an integer valued height $h_{i}$. The Hamiltonian is

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}=\frac{K}{2} \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle}\left|h_{i}-h_{j}\right|^{\infty},
$$

where the " $\infty$ " power means that there is no energy cost for $\Delta h=0$; an energy cost of $K / 2$ for $\Delta h= \pm 1$; and $\Delta h= \pm 2$ or higher are not allowed for neighboring sites. (This is known as the restricted solid on solid (RSOS) model.)
(a) Construct the dual model either diagrammatically, or by following these steps:
(i) Change from the $N$ site variables $h_{i}$, to the $2 N$ bond variables $n_{i j}=h_{i}-h_{j}$. Show that the sum of $n_{i j}$ around any plaquette is constrained to be zero.
(ii) Impose the constraints by using the identity $\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \mathrm{~d} \theta \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \theta n} / 2 \pi=\delta_{n, 0}$, for integer $n$.
(iii) After imposing the constraints, you can sum freely over the bond variables $n_{i j}$ to obtain a dual interaction $\tilde{v}\left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{j}\right)$ between dual variables $\theta_{i}$ on neighboring plaquettes.
(b) Show that for large $K$, the dual problem is just the XY model. Is this conclusion consistent with the renormalization group results of the previous problem? (Also note the connection with the loop model considered in the problems of the previous chapter.)
(c) Does the one dimensional version of this Hamiltonian, i.e. a 2d interface with

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=-\frac{K}{2} \sum_{i}\left|h_{i}-h_{i+1}\right|^{\infty},
$$

have a roughening transition?

5. Nonlinear $\sigma$ model with long-range interactions: Consider unit $n$-component spins, $\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})=\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \cdots, s_{n}\right)$ with $|\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})|^{2}=\sum_{i} s_{i}(\mathbf{x})^{2}=1$, interacting via a Hamiltonian

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}=\int \mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{y} K(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|) \vec{s}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \vec{s}(\mathbf{y})
$$

(a) The long-range interaction, $K(x)$, is the Fourier transform of $K q^{\omega} / 2$ with $\omega<2$. What kind of asymptotic decay of interactions at long distances is consistent with such decay? (Dimensional analysis is sufficient for the answer, and no explicit integrations are required.)
(b) Close to zero temperature we can set $\vec{s}(\mathbf{x})=(\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x}), \sigma(\mathbf{x}))$, where $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$ is an $n-1$ component vector representing small fluctuations around the ground state. Find the effective Hamiltonian for $\vec{\pi}(\mathbf{x})$ after integrating out $\{\sigma(\mathbf{x})\}$.
(c) Fourier transform the quadratic part of the above Hamiltonian focusing only on terms proportional to $K$, and hence calculate the expectation value $\left\langle\pi_{i}(\mathbf{q}) \pi_{j}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle_{0}$.

We shall now construct a renormalization group by removing Fourier modes, $\vec{\pi}^{>}(\mathbf{q})$, with $\mathbf{q}$ in the shell $\Lambda / b<|\mathbf{q}|<\Lambda$.
(d) Calculate the coarse grained expectation value for $\langle\sigma\rangle_{0}^{>}$to order of $\pi^{2}$ after removing these modes. Identify the scaling factor, $\vec{s}^{\prime}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)=\vec{s}<(\mathbf{x}) / \zeta$, that restores $\vec{s}^{\prime}$ to unit length.
(e) A simplifying feature of long-range interactions is that the coarse grained coupling constant is not modified by the perturbation, i.e. $\tilde{K}=K$ to all orders in a perturbative calculation. Use this information, along with simple dimensional analysis, to express the renormalized interaction, $K^{\prime}(b)$, in terms of $K, b$, and $\zeta$.
(f) Obtain the differential RG equation for $T=1 / K$ by considering $b=1+\delta \ell$.
(g) For $d=\omega+\epsilon$, compute $T_{c}$ and the critical exponent $\nu$ to lowest order in $\epsilon$.
(h) Add a small symmetry breaking term, $-\vec{h} \cdot \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x} \vec{s}(\mathbf{x})$, to the Hamiltonian. Find the renormalization of $h$ and identify the corresponding exponent $y_{h}$.

6. The XY model in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions: The recursion relations of the XY model in two dimensions can be generalized to $d=2+\epsilon$ dimensions, and take the form:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=-\epsilon T+4 \pi^{3} y^{2} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} \ell}=\left(2-\frac{\pi}{T}\right) y
\end{array}\right.
$$

(a) Calculate the position of the fixed point for the finite temperature phase transition.
(b) Obtain the eigenvalues at this fixed point to lowest contributing order in $\epsilon$.
(c) Estimate the exponents $\nu$ and $\alpha$ for the superfluid transition in $d=3$ from these results. [Be careful in keeping track of only the lowest nontrivial power of $\epsilon$ in your expressions.]

7. Symmetry breaking fields: Let us investigate adding a term

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}_{p}=h_{p} \int \mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{x} \cos (p \theta(\mathbf{x}))
$$

to the XY model. There are a number of possible causes for such a symmetry breaking field: $p=1$ is the usual "magnetic field", $p=2,3,4$, and 6 could be due to couplings to an underlying lattice of rectangular, hexagonal, square, or triangular symmetry respectively. As $h_{p} \rightarrow \infty$, the spin becomes discrete, taking one of $p$ possible values, and the model becomes equivalent to the previously discussed clock models.
(a) Assume that we are in the low-temperature phase so that vortices are absent, i.e. the vortex fugacity $y$ is zero (in the RG sense). In this case, we can ignore the angular nature of $\theta$ and replace it with a scalar field $\phi$, leading to the partition function

$$
Z=\int D \phi(x) \exp \left\{-\int \mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{x}\left[\frac{K}{2}(\nabla \phi)^{2}+h_{p} \cos (p \phi)\right]\right\}
$$

This is known as the sine-Gordon model, and is equivalent to the roughening transition of a previous problem. Use similar methods to obtain the recursion relations for $h_{p}$ and $K$.
(b) Show that once vortices are included, the recursion relations are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} h_{p}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell} & =\left(2-\frac{p^{2}}{4 \pi K}\right) h_{p} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} K^{-1}}{\mathrm{~d} \ell} & =-\frac{\pi p^{2} h_{p}^{2}}{2} K^{-2}+4 \pi^{3} y^{2}, \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} \ell} & =(2-\pi K) y .
\end{aligned}
$$

(c) Show that the above RG equations are only valid for $\frac{8 \pi}{p^{2}}<K^{-1}<\frac{\pi}{2}$, and thus only apply for $p>4$. Sketch possible phase diagrams for $p>4$ and $p<4$. In fact $p=4$ is rather special as there is a marginal operator $h_{4}$, and the transition to the four-fold phase (cubic anisotropy) has continuously varying critical exponents!

8. Inverse-square interactions: Consider a scalar field $s(x)$ in one-dimension, subject to an energy

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}_{s}=\frac{K}{2} \int \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y \frac{s(x) s(y)}{|x-y|^{2}}+\int \mathrm{d} x \Phi[s(x)]
$$

The local energy $\Phi[s]$ strongly favors $s(x)= \pm 1$ (e.g. $\Phi[s]=g\left(s^{2}-1\right)^{2}$, with $g \gg 1$ ).
(a) With $K>0$, the ground state is ferromagnetic. Estimate the energy cost of a single domain wall in a chain of length $L$. You may assume that the transition from $s=+1$ to $s=-1$ occurs over a short distance cutoff $a$.
(b) From the probability of the formation of a single kink, obtain a lower bound for the critical coupling $K_{c}$, separating ordered and disordered phases.
(c) Show that the energy of a dilute set of domain walls located at positions $\left\{x_{i}\right\}$ is given by

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}_{Q}=4 K \sum_{i<j} q_{i} q_{j} \ln \left(\frac{\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\right|}{a}\right)+\ln y_{0} \sum_{i}\left|q_{i}\right|
$$

where $q_{i}= \pm 1$ depending on whether $s(x)$ increases or decreases at the domain wall. (Hints: Perform integrations by part, and coarse-grain to size $a$. The function $\Phi[s]$ only contributes to the core energy of the domain wall, which results in the fugacity $y_{0}$.)
(d) The logarithmic interaction between two opposite domain walls at a large distance $L$ is reduced due to screening by other domain walls in between. This interaction can be calculated perturbatively in $y_{0}$, and to lowest order is described by an effective coupling (see later)

$$
\begin{equation*}
K \rightarrow K_{\mathrm{eff}}=K-2 K y_{0}^{2} \int_{a}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} r r\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{4 K}+\mathcal{O}\left(y_{0}^{4}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

By changing the cutoff from $a$ to $b a=(1+\delta \ell) a$, construct differential recursion relations for the parameters $K$ and $y_{0}$.
(e) Sketch the renormalization group flows as a function of $T=K^{-1}$ and $y_{0}$, and discuss the phases of the model.
(f) Derive the effective interaction given above as Eq. (1). (Hint: This is somewhat easier than the corresponding calculation for the two-dimensional Coulomb gas, as the charges along the chain must alternate.)

9. Melting: The elastic energy cost of a deformation $u_{i}(\mathbf{x})$, of an isotropic lattice is

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=\frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{x}\left[2 \mu u_{i j} u_{i j}+\lambda u_{i i} u_{j j}\right]
$$

where $u_{i j}(\mathbf{x})=\left(\partial_{i} u_{j}+\partial_{j} u_{i}\right) / 2$ is the strain tensor.
(a) Express the energy in terms of the Fourier transforms $u_{i}(\mathbf{q})$, and find the normal modes of vibrations.
(b) Calculate the expectation value $\left\langle u_{i}(\mathbf{q}) u_{j}\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle$.
(c) Assuming a short-distance cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing $a$, calculate $U^{2}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv\left\langle(\vec{u}(\mathbf{x})-\vec{u}(\mathbf{0}))^{2}\right\rangle$.
(d) The (heuristic) Lindemann criterion states that the lattice melts when deformations grow to a fraction of the lattice spacing, i.e. for $\lim _{|\mathbf{x}| \rightarrow \infty} U(\mathbf{x})=c_{L} a$. Assuming that $\mu=\hat{\mu} /\left(k_{\mathrm{B}} T\right)$ and $\lambda=\hat{\lambda} /\left(k_{\mathrm{B}} T\right)$, use the above criterion to calculate the melting temperature $T_{m}$. Comment on the behavior of $T_{m}$ as a function of dimension $d$.
