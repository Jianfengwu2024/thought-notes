## Series expansions

### 7.1 Low-temperature expansions

Lattice models can also be studied by series expansions. Such expansions start with certain exactly solvable limits, and typically represent perturbations around such limits by graphs on the lattice. High-temperature expansions are described in the next section. Here we describe the low-temperature expansion for the Ising model with a Hamiltonian $-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}$, on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. The ground state with $K=\beta J>0$ is ferromagnetic, e.g. with $\sigma_{i}=+1$ for all spins. A series expansion for the partition function is obtained by including low energy excitations around this state. The lowest energy excitation is a single overturned spin. Any of $N$ sites can be chosen for this excitation, which has an energy cost of $2 K \times 2 d$, with respect to the ground state. The next lowest energy excitation corresponds to a dimer of negative spins with energy cost of $2 K \times(4 d-2)$, and a multiplicity of $N \times d$ (there are $d$ possible orientations for the dimer). The first few terms in the expansion give

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=2 \mathrm{e}^{N d K}\left[1+N \mathrm{e}^{-4 d K}+d N \mathrm{e}^{-4(2 d-1) K}+\frac{N(N-2 d-1)}{2} \mathrm{e}^{-8 d K}+\cdots\right] \tag{7.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

The fourth term comes from flipping two disjoint single spins. The zeroth order term comes from the ground state, which has a two-fold degeneracy. The overall factor of 2 is insignificant in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z \simeq \mathrm{e}^{N d K} \sum_{\text {droplets of } \Theta \text { spins }} \mathrm{e}^{-2 K \times \text { boundary of droplet }} \tag{7.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Fig. 7.1 Low-energy excitations as islands of negative spins in the sea of positive spins. The energies and multiplicities on the right refer to a hypercubic lattice in $d$-dimensions.

The free energy per site is obtained from the series,

$$
\begin{align*}
-\beta f=\frac{\ln Z}{N} & =d K+\frac{1}{N} \ln \left[1+N \mathrm{e}^{-4 d K}+d N \mathrm{e}^{-4(2 d-1) K}+\frac{N(N-2 d-1)}{2} \mathrm{e}^{-8 d K}+\cdots\right] \\
& =d K+\mathrm{e}^{-4 d K}+d \mathrm{e}^{-4(2 d-1) K}-\frac{(2 d+1)}{2} \mathrm{e}^{-8 d K}+\cdots \tag{7.3}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that there is an explicit cancellation of the term proportional to $N^{2}$ in the expansion for $Z$. Such higher $N$ dependences result from disconnected diagrams with several disjoint droplets. Extensivity of the free energy insures that these terms are canceled by products of connected graphs. The energy per site is then obtained from

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{E}{N} & =-\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\left(\frac{\ln Z}{N}\right)=-J \frac{\partial}{\partial K}\left(\frac{\ln Z}{N}\right) \\
& =-J\left[d-4 d \mathrm{e}^{-4 d K}-4 d(2 d-1) \mathrm{e}^{-4(2 d-1) K}+4 d(2 d+1) \mathrm{e}^{-8 d K}+\cdots\right] \tag{7.4}
\end{align*}
$$

and the heat capacity is proportional to

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{C}{N k_{\mathrm{B}}} & =\frac{1}{N k_{\mathrm{B}}} \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}=-\frac{K^{2}}{N J} \frac{\partial E}{\partial K} \\
& =K^{2}\left[16 d^{2} \mathrm{e}^{-4 d K}+16 d(2 d-1)^{2} \mathrm{e}^{-4(2 d-1) K}-32 d^{2}(2 d+1) \mathrm{e}^{-8 d K}+\cdots\right] \tag{7.5}
\end{align*}
$$

Can such series be used to extract the critical coupling $K_{c}$, and more importantly, the singularities associated with the disordering transition? Suppose that we have identified a number of terms in a series $C=\sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} a_{\ell} u^{\ell}$. From the expected divergence of the heat capacity, we expect an asymptotic expansion of the form

$$
\begin{align*}
C \simeq A\left(1-\frac{u}{u_{c}}\right)^{-\alpha} & =A\left[1+\frac{\alpha}{u_{c}} u+\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)}{2!u_{c}^{2}} u^{2} \cdots+\right.  \tag{7.6}\\
& \left.+\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1) \cdots(\alpha+\ell-1)}{\ell!u_{c}^{\ell}} u^{\ell} \cdots\right] .
\end{align*}
$$

The above singular form is characterized by the three parameters $A, u_{c}$, and $\alpha$. We can try to extract these parameters from the calculated coefficients in the series by requiring that they match at large $\ell$, i.e. by fitting the ratio of successive terms to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_{\ell}}{a_{\ell-1}} \simeq\left(\frac{\alpha+\ell-1}{\ell u_{c}}\right)=u_{c}^{-1}\left(1+\frac{\alpha-1}{\ell}\right) . \tag{7.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus a plot of $a_{\ell} / a_{\ell-1}$ versus $1 / \ell$ should be a straight line with intercept $u_{c}^{-1}$, and slope $u_{c}^{-1}(\alpha-1)$. Note, however, that adding a finite sum $\sum_{\ell=0}^{\ell_{m}} d_{\ell} u^{\ell}$ does not change the asymptotic singular form, but essentially renders the first $\ell_{m}$
terms useless in determining $\alpha$ and $u_{c}^{-1}$. There is thus no a priori guarantee that such a fitting procedure will succeed with a finite number of coefficients. In practice, this procedure works very well and very good estimates of critical exponents in $d=3$ (e.g. $\alpha=0.105 \pm 0.007$ ) are obtained in this way by including a rather large number of terms.

The three terms calculated for the heat capacity in Eq. (7.5) have different signs, unlike those of Eq. (7.6). As this continues at higher orders in $\mathrm{e}^{-K}$, the ratio fitting procedure described above cannot be used directly. The alternation of signs usually signifies singularities in the complex $z=\mathrm{e}^{-K}$ plane, closer to the origin than the critical point of interest at real $z_{c}=\mathrm{e}^{-K_{c}}$. If it is possible to construct a mapping $u(z)$ on the complex plane such that the spurious singularities are pushed further away than $u_{c}=u\left(z_{c}\right)$, then the ratio method can be used. In the case of low-temperature series, the choice of $u=\tanh K$ achieves this goal. (As we shall demonstrate shortly, $\tanh K$ is also the natural variable for the high-temperature expansion.) Quite sophisticated methods, such as Padé approximants, have been developed for analyzing the singular behavior of series.

Low temperature expansions can be similarly constructed for other discrete spin systems, such as the Potts model. For continuous spins, the low energy excitations are Goldstone modes, and the perturbation series cannot be represented in terms of lattice graphs. The low-temperature description in this case starts with the Gaussian treatment of the Goldstone modes, as carried out in the first problem of chapter 3 for the case of the XY model. Further terms in the series involve interactions between such modes, and a corresponding calculation will be performed in the next chapter.

### 7.2 High-temperature expansions

High-temperature expansions work equally well for discrete and continuous spin systems. The basic idea is to start with independent spins, and expand the partition function in powers of $\beta=\left(k_{\mathrm{B}} T\right)^{-1}$, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}}\right)=\operatorname{tr}\left[1-\beta \mathcal{H}+\frac{\beta^{2} \mathcal{H}^{2}}{2}-\cdots\right], \tag{7.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\frac{\ln Z_{0}}{N}-\beta \frac{\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle_{0}}{N}+\frac{\beta^{2}}{2} \frac{\left\langle\mathcal{H}^{2}\right\rangle_{0}-\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle_{0}^{2}}{N}-\cdots \tag{7.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The averages $\left\rangle_{0}\right.$ are calculated over non-interacting spins. For the Ising model, it is more convenient to organize the expansion in powers of $\tanh K$ as follows. Since $\left(\sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right)^{2}=1$, the Boltzmann factor for each bond can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{e}^{K \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}}=\frac{\mathrm{e}^{K}+\mathrm{e}^{-K}}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{e}^{K}-\mathrm{e}^{-K}}{2} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}=\cosh K\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right), \tag{7.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $t \equiv \tanh K$ is a good high-temperature expansion parameter. Applying this transformation to each bond of the lattice results in

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}} \mathrm{e}^{K \sum\langle i, j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}=(\cosh K)^{\text {number of bonds }} \sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}\langle i, j\rangle} \prod_{i}\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right) . \tag{7.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $N_{b}$ bonds on the lattice, the above product generates $2^{N_{b}}$ terms, which can be represented diagrammatically by drawing a line connecting sites $i$ and $j$ for each factor of $t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}$. Note that there can at most be one such line for each lattice bond, which is either empty or occupied. This is a major simplification, and a major advantage for the use of $t$, rather than $K$, as the expansion parameter. Each site now obtains a factor of $\sigma_{i}^{p_{i}}$, where $p_{i}$ is the number of occupied bonds emanating from $i$. Summing over the two possible values $\sigma_{i}= \pm 1$, gives a factor of 2 if $p_{i}$ is even, and 0 if $p_{i}$ is odd. Thus, the only graphs that survive the sum have an even number of lines passing through each site. The resulting graphs are collections of closed paths on the lattice, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=2^{N} \times(\cosh K)^{N_{b}} \sum_{\text {All closed graphs }} t^{\text {number of bonds in the graph }} \tag{7.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-137.jpg?height=271&width=618&top_left_y=1463&top_left_x=800)

For a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice, the smallest closed graph is a square of four bonds which has $d(d-1) / 2$ possible orientations. As the next graph has six bonds,

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=2^{N}(\cosh K)^{d N}\left[1+\frac{d(d-1) N}{2} t^{4}+d(d-1)(2 d-3) t^{6}+\cdots\right] \tag{7.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln 2+d \ln \cosh K+\frac{d(d-1)}{2} t^{4}+\cdots \tag{7.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the following sections we shall employ high-temperature expansions not as a numerical tool, but to establish the following: (a) exact solution of the Ising model in $d=1$; (b) the duality relating models at low and high temperatures; (c) the validity of the Gaussian model in high dimensions; (d) exact solution of the Ising model in $d=2$.

### 7.3 Exact solution of the one-dimensional Ising model

The graphical method provides a rapid way of solving the Ising model at zero field in $d=1$. We can compare and contrast the solutions on chains with open and closed (periodic) boundary conditions.
(1) An open chain of $N$ sites has $N_{b}=N-1$ bonds. It is impossible to draw any closed graphs on such a lattice, and hence

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=2^{N} \cosh K^{N-1} \times 1 \Longrightarrow \frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln [2 \cosh K]-\frac{\ln [\cosh K]}{N} \tag{7.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

The same method can also be used to calculate the correlation function $\left\langle\sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}\right\rangle$, since

$$
\begin{align*}
&\left\langle\sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\left\langle\sigma_{i}\right\}} \mathrm{e}^{K \sum\{i, j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j} \\
& \sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}  \tag{7.16}\\
&=\frac{2^{N}(\cosh K)^{N-1}}{Z} \sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}} \sigma_{m} \sigma_{n} \prod_{\langle i, j\rangle}\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right) .
\end{align*}
$$

The terms in the numerator involve an additional factor of $\sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}$. To get a finite value after summing over $\sigma_{m}= \pm 1$ and $\sigma_{n}= \pm 1$, we have to examine graphs with an odd number of bonds emanating from these external sites. The only such graph for the open chain is one that directly connects these two sites, and results in

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}\right\rangle=t^{|m-n|}=\mathrm{e}^{-|m-n| / \xi}, \quad \text { with } \quad \xi=-\frac{1}{\ln \tanh K} \tag{7.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

These results are in agreement with the RG conclusions of Section 6.4; the correlation length diverges as $\mathrm{e}^{2 K}$ for $K \rightarrow \infty$, and there is no power law modifying the exponential decay of correlations.

Fig. 7.4 The open chain (top), and the closed chain (bottom).

(2) A closed chain has the same number of sites and bonds, $N$. It is now possible to draw a closed graph that circles the whole chain, and

$$
\begin{align*}
Z=(2 \cosh K)^{N}\left[1+t^{N}\right] & =2^{N}\left(\cosh K^{N}+\sinh K^{N}\right) \\
\Longrightarrow \frac{\ln Z}{N} & =\ln (2 \cosh K)+\frac{\ln \left[1+t^{N}\right]}{N} . \tag{7.1.}
\end{align*}
$$

The difference between the free energies of closed and open chains vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. The correction to the extensive free energy, $N \ln (2 \cosh K)$, is of the order of $1 / N$ for the open chain, and can be regarded as the surface free energy. There is no such correction for the closed chain, which has no boundaries; there is instead an exponential term $t^{N}$. The correlation function can again be calculated from Eq. (7.16). There are two paths connecting the points $m$ and $n$, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\sigma_{m} \sigma_{n}\right\rangle=\frac{t^{|m-n|}+t^{N-|m-n|}}{1+t^{N}} \tag{7.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that the final answer is symmetric with respect to the two ways of measuring the distance between the two sites $m$ and $n$.

### 7.4 Self-duality in the two-dimensional Ising model

Kramers and Wannier discovered a hidden symmetry that relates the properties of the Ising model on the square lattice at low and high temperatures. One way of obtaining this symmetry is to compare the high and low temperature series expansions of the problem. The low-temperature expansion has the form

$$
\begin{align*}
Z & =\mathrm{e}^{2 N K}\left[1+N \mathrm{e}^{-4 \times 2 K}+2 N \mathrm{e}^{-6 \times 2 K}+\cdots\right] \\
& =\mathrm{e}^{2 N K} \sum_{\text {Islands of }(-) \text { spins }} \mathrm{e}^{-2 K \times \text { perimeter of island }} . \tag{7.20}
\end{align*}
$$

The high-temperature series is

$$
\begin{align*}
Z & =2^{N} \cosh K^{2 N}\left[1+N \tanh K^{4}+2 N \tanh K^{6}+\cdots\right] \\
& =2^{N} \cosh K^{2 N} \sum_{\text {graphs with } 2 \text { or } 4 \text { lines per site }} \tanh K^{\text {length of graph } .} \tag{7.21}
\end{align*}
$$

As the boundary of any island of spins serves as an acceptable graph (and vice versa), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two series. Defining a function $g$ to indicate the logarithm of the above series, the free energy is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=2 K+g\left(\mathrm{e}^{-2 K}\right)=\ln 2+2 \ln \cosh K+g(\tanh K) . \tag{7.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

The arguments of $g$ in the above equation are related by the duality condition

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{e}^{-2 \tilde{K}} \leftrightarrow \tanh K, \Longrightarrow \tilde{K}=D(K) \equiv-\frac{1}{2} \ln \tanh K . \tag{7.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-140.jpg?height=528&width=623&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)

The function $g$ (which contains the singular part of the free energy) must have a special symmetry that relates its values for dual arguments. (For example the function $f(x)=x /\left(1+x^{2}\right)$ equals $f\left(x^{-1}\right)$, establishing a duality between the arguments at $x$ and $x^{-1}$.) Equation (7.23) has the following properties:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-140.jpg?height=352&width=575&top_left_y=1097&top_left_x=456)
(1) Low temperatures are mapped to high temperatures, and vice versa.
(2) The mapping connects pairs of points since $D(D(K))=K$. This condition is established by using trigonometric identities to show that

$$
\begin{align*}
\sinh 2 K & =2 \sinh K \cosh K=2 \tanh K \cosh ^{2} K \\
& =\frac{2 \tanh K}{1-\tanh ^{2} K}=\frac{2 \mathrm{e}^{-} 2 \tilde{K}}{1-\mathrm{e}^{-4 \tilde{K}}}=\frac{2}{\mathrm{e}^{2 \tilde{K}}-\mathrm{e}^{-2 \tilde{K}}}=\frac{1}{\sinh 2 \tilde{K}} . \tag{7.24}
\end{align*}
$$

Hence, the dual interactions are symmetrically related by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sinh 2 K \cdot \sinh 2 \tilde{K}=1 \tag{7.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

(3) If the function $g(K)$ is singular at a point $K_{c}$, it must also be singular at $\tilde{K}_{c}$. Since the free energy is expected to be analytic everywhere except at the transition, the critical model must be self-dual. At the self-dual point

$$
\mathrm{e}^{-2 K_{c}}=\tanh K_{c}=\frac{1-\mathrm{e}^{-2 K_{c}}}{1+\mathrm{e}^{-2 K_{c}}},
$$

Fig. 7.5 There is a one-to-one correspondence between terms in the high and low temperature series for the Ising model on the square lattice.

Fig. 7.6 The function $D(K)$ relating the parameter $K$ to its dual value.

Fig. 7.7 The duality function maps pairs of points from high and low temperatures. The self-dual point at $K_{c}$ maps onto itself.

Clearly the two sums are different, and the $3 d$ Ising model is not dual to itself. Is there any other Hamiltonian whose high-temperature series reproduces the low-temperature terms for the $3 d$ Ising model? To construct such a model note that:
(1) The low-temperature terms have the form $\mathrm{e}^{-2 K \times \text { area }}$, and the area is the sum of faces covered on the cubic lattice. Thus plaquettes must replace bonds as the building blocks of the required high temperature series.
(2) How should these plaquettes be joined together? The number of bonds next to a site can be anywhere from 3 to 12 while there are only two or four faces adjacent to each bond. This suggests "gluing" the plaquettes together by placing spins $\tilde{\sigma}_{i}= \pm 1$ on the bonds of the lattice.
(3) By analogy to the Ising model, we can construct a partition function,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{Z}=\sum_{\left\{\tilde{\sigma}_{P}= \pm 1\right\}} \prod_{\text {plaquettes } P}\left(1+\tanh \tilde{K} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{1} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{2} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{3} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{4}\right) \propto \sum_{\left\{\tilde{\sigma}_{i}\right\}} \mathrm{e}^{\tilde{K} \sum P \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{1} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{2} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{3} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{4},} \tag{7.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{i}$ are used to denote the four dual spins around each plaquette, and $\tilde{K}$ is given by Eq. (7.23). This partition function describes a system dual to the original $3 d$ Ising model, in the sense of reproducing its low-temperature series. (Some reflection demonstrates that the low-temperature expansion of the above partition function reproduces the high-temperature expansion of the Ising model.)
Equation (7.29) describes a $Z_{2}$ lattice gauge theory. The general rules for constructing such theories in all dimensions are: (i) place Ising spins $\tilde{\sigma}_{i}= \pm 1$ on the bonds of the lattice; (ii) the Hamiltonian is $-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\text {all plaquettes }} \Pi \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{i}$. In addition to the global Ising symmetry, $\tilde{\sigma}_{i} \rightarrow-\tilde{\sigma}_{i}$, the Hamiltonian has a local or gauge symmetry. To observe this symmetry, select any site and change the signs of spins on all bonds emanating from it. As in each of the faces adjacent to the chosen site two bond spins change sign, their product, and hence the overall energy, is not changed.

There is a rigorous proof (Elitzur's theorem) that there can be no spontaneous symmetry breaking for Hamiltonians with a local symmetry. The essence of the proof is that even in the presence of a symmetry breaking field $h$, the energy cost of flipping a spin is finite ( $6 h$ for the gauge theory on the cubic lattice). Hence the expectation value of spin changes continuously as $h \rightarrow 0$. (By contrast, the energy cost of a spin flip in the Ising model grows as Nh.) This theorem presents us with the following paradox: Since the three dimensional Ising model undergoes a phase transition, there must be a singularity in its partition function, and also that of its dual. How can there be a singularity in the partition function of the three-dimensional gauge theory if it does not undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking?

To resolve this contradiction, Wegner suggested the possibility of a phase transition without a local order parameter. The two phases are then distinguished by the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions. The appropriate correlation
function must be invariant under the local gauge transformation. For example, the Wilson loop is constructed by selecting a closed path of bonds $S$ on the lattice and examining

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{S}=\langle\text { Product of } \tilde{\sigma} \text { around the loop }\rangle=\left\langle\prod_{i \in S} \tilde{\sigma}_{i}\right\rangle . \tag{7.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

As any gauge transformation changes the signs of two bonds on the loop, their product is unaffected and $C_{S}$ is gauge invariant. Since the Hamiltonian encourages spins of the same sign, this expectation value is always positive. Let us examine the asymptotic dependence of $C_{S}$ on the shape of the loop at high and low temperatures. In a high-temperature expansion, the correlation function is obtained as a sum of all graphs constructed from plaquettes with $S$ as a boundary. Each plaquette contributes a factor of $\tanh \tilde{K}$, and

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{S} & =\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\left\{\tilde{\sigma}_{i}\right\}} \prod_{i \in S} \tilde{\sigma}_{i} \mathrm{e}^{K \sum_{P} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{1} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{2} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{3} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{4}} \\
& =(\tanh \tilde{K})^{\text {Area of } S}\left[1+\mathcal{O}\left(\tanh \tilde{K}^{2}\right)\right] \approx \exp [-f(\tanh \tilde{K}) \times \operatorname{Area} \text { of } S] \tag{7.31}
\end{align*}
$$

The low-temperature expansion starts with the lowest energy configuration. There are in fact $\mathcal{N}_{G}=2^{N}$ such ground states related by gauge transformations. The $N_{P}$ plaquette interactions are satisfied in the ground states, and excitations involve creating unsatisfied plaquettes. Since $C_{S}$ is gauge independent, it is sufficient to look at one of the ground states, e.g. the one with $\tilde{\sigma}_{i}=+1$ for all $i$. Flipping the sign of any of the $3 N$ bonds creates an excitation of energy $8 \tilde{K}$ with respect to the ground state. Denoting the number of bonds on the perimeter of the Wilson loop by $P_{S}$, we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{S} & =\frac{\mathcal{N}_{G}}{\mathcal{N}_{G}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\tilde{K} N_{P}}\left[1+\left(3 N-P_{S}\right) \mathrm{e}^{-2 \tilde{K} \times 4}(+1)+(-1) P_{S} \mathrm{e}^{-2 \tilde{K} \times 4}+\cdots\right]}{\mathrm{e}^{\tilde{K} N_{P}}\left[1+3 N \mathrm{e}^{-2 \tilde{K} \times 4}+\cdots\right]} \\
& =1-2 P_{S} \mathrm{e}^{-8 \tilde{K}}+\cdots  \tag{7.32}\\
& \approx \exp \left[-2 \mathrm{e}^{-8 \tilde{K}} P_{S}+\cdots\right] .
\end{align*}
$$

The asymptotic decay of $C_{S}$ is thus different at high and low temperatures. At high temperatures, the decay is controlled by the area of the loop, while at low temperatures it depends on its length. The phase transition marks the change from one type of decay to the other, and by duality has the same singularities in free energy as the Ising model.

The prototype of gauge theories in physics is quantum electrodynamics (QED), with the action

$$
\begin{equation*}
S=\int \mathrm{d}^{4} \mathbf{x}\left[\bar{\psi}(-i d+e \mathbb{X}+m) \psi+\frac{1}{4}\left(\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}\right)^{2}\right] . \tag{7.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

The spinor $\psi$ is the Dirac field for the electron, and the 4 -vector $A$ describes the electromagnetic gauge potential. The phase of $\psi$ is not observable, and the action is invariant under the gauge symmetry $\psi \mapsto \mathrm{e}^{i e \phi} \psi$, and $A_{\mu} \mapsto A_{\mu}-\partial_{\mu} \phi$, for any $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. The $Z_{2}$ lattice gauge theory can be regarded as the Ising analog of QED with the bond spins playing the role of the electromagnetic field. We can introduce a "matter" field by placing spins $s_{i}= \pm 1$, on the sites of the lattice. The two fields are coupled by the Hamiltonian,

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\beta \mathcal{H}=J \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} s_{i} \tilde{\sigma}_{i j} s_{j}+K \sum_{P} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{1} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{2} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{3} \tilde{\sigma}_{P}^{4}, \tag{7.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\tilde{\sigma}_{i j}$ is the spin on the bond joining $i$ and $j$. The Hamiltonian has the gauge symmetry $s_{i} \mapsto(-1) s_{i}$, and $\tilde{\sigma}_{i, \mu} \mapsto-\tilde{\sigma}_{i, \mu}$, for all bonds emanating from any site $i$.

Regarding one of the lattice directions as time, a Wilson loop is obtained by creating two particles at a distance $x$, propagating them for a time $t$, and then removing them. The probability of such an event is roughly given by $C_{S} \sim \mathrm{e}^{-U(x) t}$, where $U(x)$ is the interaction between the two particles. In the high-temperature phase, $C_{S}$ decays with the area of the loop, suggesting $U(x) t=$ $f(\tanh \tilde{K})|x| t$. The resulting potential $U(x)=f(\tanh \tilde{K})|x|$, is like a string that connects the particles together. This is also the potential that describes the confinement of quarks at large distances in quantum chromodynamics. The decay with the length of the loop at low temperatures implies $U(x) t \approx$ $g\left(\mathrm{e}^{-8 \tilde{K}}\right)(|x|+t)$. For $t \gg|x|$ the potential is a constant and the force vanishes. (This asymptotic freedom describes the behavior of quarks at short distances.) The phase transition implies a change in the nature of interactions between particles mediated by the gauge field.

### 7.6 Summing over phantom loops

The high-temperature series can be approximately summed so as to reproduce the Gaussian model. This correspondence provides a better understanding of why Gaussian behavior is applicable in high dimensions, and also prepares the way for the exact summation of the series in two dimensions in the next section. The high-temperature series for the partition function of the Ising model on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice is obtained from

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}} \mathrm{e}^{K \sum_{\langle i j} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}}=2^{N} \cosh ^{d N} K \times S, \tag{7.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S$ is the sum over all allowed graphs on the lattice, each weighted by $t \equiv \tanh K$ raised to the power of the number of bonds in the graph. The allowed graphs have an even number of bonds per site. The simplest graphs have the topology of a single closed loop. There are also graphs composed of disconnected closed loops.

Fig. 7.9 Terms of the high-temperature series organized as sums over loops.

Fig. 7.10 The sum over phantom loops can be exponentiated.

Keeping in mind the cumulant expansion, we can set

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Xi=\text { sum over contribution of all graphs with one loop, } \tag{7.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

and introduce another sum,

$$
\begin{align*}
S^{\prime} & =\exp (\Xi)=1+\Xi+\frac{1}{2}(\Xi)^{2}+\frac{1}{6}(\Xi)^{3}+\cdots  \tag{7.37}\\
& =1+(1 \text { loop graphs })+(2 \text { loop graphs })+(3 \text { loop graphs })+\cdots
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
S^{\prime}=\exp (\Omega) & =1+(\Omega)+\frac{1}{2}(\Omega)^{2}+\frac{1}{3!}(\Omega)^{3}+\cdots \\
& =1+\Omega+3\}+3\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Despite their similarities, the sums $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ are not identical: There are ambiguities associated with loops that intersect at a single site, which will be discussed more fully in the next section. More importantly, $S^{\prime}$ includes additional graphs where a particular bond contributes more than once, while in the original sum $S$, each lattice bond contributes a factor of $1 \mathrm{or} t$. This arises because after raising $\exists$ to a power $\ell$, a particular bond may contribute up to $\ell$ times for a factor of $t^{\ell}$. In the spirit of the approximation that allows multiple appearances of a bond, we shall also include additional closed paths in $\Xi$, in which a particular bond is traversed more than once in completing the loop.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-145.jpg?height=84&width=611&top_left_y=1725&top_left_x=806)

Qualitatively, $S$ is the partition function of a gas of self-avoiding polymer loops with a monomer fugacity of $t$. The self-avoiding constraint is left out in the partition function $S^{\prime}$, which thus corresponds to a gas of phantom polymer loops, which may pass through each other with impunity. Loops of various shapes can be constructed from closed random walks on the lattice, and the corresponding free energy of phantom loops is
$\ln S^{\prime}=\sum$ all closed random walks on the lattice $\times t^{\text {length of walk }}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
=N \sum_{\ell} \frac{t^{\ell}}{\ell}(\text { number of closed walks of } \ell \text { steps starting and ending at } \mathbf{0}) \text {. } \tag{7.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that extensivity is guaranteed since (up to boundary effects) the same loop can be started from any point on the lattice. The overall factor of $1 / \ell$ accounts for the $\ell$ possible starting points for a loop of length $\ell$.

A transfer matrix method can be used to count all possible (phantom) random walks on the lattice. Let us introduce a set of $N \times N$ matrices,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\mathbf{i}| W(\ell)|\mathbf{j}\rangle \equiv \text { number of walks from } \mathbf{j} \text { to } \mathbf{i} \text { in } \ell \text { steps, } \tag{7.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

in terms of which Eq. (7.38) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln S^{\prime}}{N}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\ell} \frac{t^{\ell}}{\ell}\langle\mathbf{0}| W(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle \tag{7.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

The additional factor of 2 arises since the same loop can be traversed by two random walks moving in opposite directions. Similarly, the spin-spin correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r})\rangle=\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\left\langle\sigma_{i}\right\rangle} \sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r}) \prod_{\langle i j\rangle}\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right) \tag{7.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

is related to the sum over all paths connecting the points $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ on the lattice. In addition to the simple paths that directly connect the two points, there are disconnected graphs that contain additional closed loops. In the same approximation of allowing all intersections between paths, the partition function $S^{\prime}$ can be factored out of the numerator and denominator of Eq. (7.41), and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r}\rangle \approx \sum_{\ell} t^{\ell}\langle\mathbf{r}| W(\ell) \mid \mathbf{0}\right\rangle . \tag{7.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Fig. 7.12
High-temperature series for the two-point correlation function, and its approximation in the phantom path limit.

The counting of phantom paths on a lattice is easily accomplished by taking advantage of their Markovian property. This is the property that each step of a random walk proceeds from its last location and is independent of its previous steps. Hence, the number of walks can be calculated recursively. First, note that any walk from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{r}$ in $\ell$ steps can be accomplished as a walk from $\mathbf{0}$ to some other point $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$ in $\ell-1$ steps, followed by a single step
from $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$ to $\mathbf{r}$. Summing over all possible locations of the intermediate point leads to

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\mathbf{r}| W(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle & =\sum_{\mathbf{r}^{\prime}}\langle\mathbf{r}| W(1)\left|\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \times\left\langle\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right| W(\ell-1)|\mathbf{0}\rangle  \tag{7.43}\\
& =\langle\mathbf{r}| T W(\ell-1)|\mathbf{0}\rangle,
\end{align*}
$$

where the sum corresponds to the product of two matrices, and we have defined $T \equiv W(1)$. The recursion process can be continued and

$$
\begin{equation*}
W(\ell)=T W(\ell-1)=T^{2} W(\ell-2)^{2}=\cdots=T^{\ell} . \tag{7.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus all lattice random walks are generated by the transfer matrix $T$, whose elements are

$$
\langle\mathbf{r}| T\left|\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } \mathbf{r} \text { and } \mathbf{r}^{\prime} \text { are nearest neighbors }  \tag{7.45}\\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

(It is also called the adjacency, or connectivity matrix.) For example in $d=2$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle x, y| T\left|x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}\right\rangle=\delta_{y, y^{\prime}}\left(\delta_{x, x^{\prime}+1}+\delta_{x, x^{\prime}-1}\right)+\delta_{x, x^{\prime}}\left(\delta_{y, y^{\prime}+1}+\delta_{y, y^{\prime}-1}\right), \tag{7.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

and successive actions of $T$ on a walker starting at the origin $|x, y\rangle=\delta_{x, 0} \delta_{y, 0}$, generate the patterns
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-147.jpg?height=222&width=894&top_left_y=1492&top_left_x=662)

The value at each site is the number of walks ending at that point after $\ell$ steps.
Various properties of random walks can be deduced from diagonalizing the matrix $T$. Due to the translational symmetry of the lattice, this is achieved in the Fourier basis $\langle\mathbf{r} \mid \mathbf{q}\rangle=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{iq} \cdot \mathrm{r}} / \sqrt{N}$. For example in $d=2$, starting from Eq. (7.46), it can be checked that

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle x, y| T\left|q_{x}, q_{y}\right\rangle & =\sum_{x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}}\langle x, y| T\left|x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}\right\rangle\left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid q_{x}, q_{y}\right\rangle \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\left[\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{y} y}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{x}(x+1)}+\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{x}(x-1)}\right)+\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{x} x}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{y}(y+1)}+\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{y}(y-1)}\right)\right]  \tag{7.47}\\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x} x+q_{y} y\right)}\left[2 \cos q_{x}+2 \cos q_{y}\right]=T\left(q_{x}, q_{y}\right)\left\langle x, y \mid q_{x}, q_{y}\right\rangle .
\end{align*}
$$

The generalized eigenvalue for a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice is

$$
\begin{equation*}
T(\mathbf{q})=2 \sum_{\alpha=1}^{d} \cos q_{\alpha} \tag{7.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

The correlation function in Eq. (7.42) is now evaluated as

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\sigma(\mathbf{r}) \sigma(\mathbf{0})\rangle & \approx \sum_{\ell}^{\infty} t^{\ell}\langle\mathbf{r}| W(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=\sum_{\ell}^{\infty}\langle\mathbf{r}|(t T)^{\ell}|\mathbf{0}\rangle \\
& =\langle\mathbf{r}| \frac{1}{1-t T}|\mathbf{0}\rangle=\sum_{\mathbf{q}}\langle\mathbf{r} \mid \mathbf{q}\rangle \frac{1}{1-t T(\mathbf{q})}\langle\mathbf{q} \mid \mathbf{0}\rangle  \tag{7.49}\\
& =N \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{i \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r}}}{N} \frac{1}{1-2 t \sum_{\alpha=1}^{d} \cos q_{\alpha}}=\int \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r}}}{1-2 t \sum_{\alpha} \cos q_{\alpha}} .
\end{align*}
$$

For $t \rightarrow 0$, the shortest path costs least energy and $\langle\sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r})\rangle \sim t^{|\mathbf{r}|}$. As $t$ increases, larger paths dominate the sum because they are more numerous (i.e. entropically favored). Eventually, there is a singularity for $1-t T(\mathbf{0})=0$, i.e. at $2 d \times t_{c}=1$, when arbitrarily long paths become important. For $t<t_{c}$, the partition function is dominated by small loops, and a polymer connecting two far away points is stretched by its line tension. When the fugacity exceeds $t_{c}$, the line tension vanishes and loops of arbitrary size are generated. Clearly the neglect of intersections (which stabilizes the system at a finite density) is no longer justified in this limit. This transition is the manifestation of Ising ordering in the language of paths representing the high-temperature series. On approaching the transition from the high-temperature side, the sums are dominated by very long paths. Accordingly, the denominator of Eq. (7.49) can be expanded for small $\mathbf{q}$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
1-t T(\mathbf{q}) & =1-2 t \sum_{\alpha=1}^{d} \cos q_{\alpha} \simeq(1-2 d t)+t q^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(q^{4}\right) \\
& \approx t_{c}\left(\xi^{-2}+q^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(q^{4}\right)\right) \tag{7.50}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\xi \equiv\left(\frac{1-2 d t}{t_{c}}\right)^{-1 / 2} \tag{7.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

The resulting correlation functions,

$$
\langle\sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r})\rangle \propto \int \frac{\mathrm{d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r}}}{q^{2}+\xi^{-2}},
$$

are identical to those obtained from the Gaussian model, and (Sec. 3.2)

$$
\langle\sigma(\mathbf{0}) \sigma(\mathbf{r})\rangle \propto \begin{cases}\frac{1}{r^{d-2}} & \text { for } r<\xi \quad(\eta=0)  \tag{7.52}\\ \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-r / \xi}}{r^{(d-1) / 2}} & \text { for } r>\xi .\end{cases}
$$

The correlation length in Eq. (7.51) diverges as $\xi \sim\left(t_{c}-t\right)^{-1 / 2}$, i.e. with the Gaussian exponent of $\nu=1 / 2$.

We can also calculate the free energy in Eq. (7.40) as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\ln S^{\prime}}{N} & =\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\ell}^{\infty} \frac{t^{\ell}}{\ell}\langle\mathbf{0}| W(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=\frac{1}{2}\langle\mathbf{0}| \sum_{\ell}^{\infty} \frac{t^{\ell} T^{\ell}}{\ell}|\mathbf{0}\rangle \\
& =-\frac{1}{2}\langle\mathbf{0}| \ln (1-t T)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=-\frac{N}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\langle\mathbf{0} \mid \mathbf{q}\rangle \ln (1-t T(\mathbf{q}))\langle\mathbf{q} \mid \mathbf{0}\rangle \\
& =-\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{d} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \ln \left(1-2 t \sum_{\alpha=1}^{d} \cos q_{\alpha}\right) . \tag{7.53}
\end{align*}
$$

In the vicinity of the critical point at $t_{c}=1 /(2 d)$, the argument of the logarithm is proportional to $\left(q^{2}+\xi^{-2}\right)$ from Eq. (7.50). This is precisely as in the Gaussian model, and as discussed in Sec. 4.6 the singular part of the free energy scales as

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\text {sing }} \propto \xi^{-d} \propto\left(t_{c}-t\right)^{d / 2} \tag{7.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

The singular part of the heat capacity, obtained after taking two derivatives, is governed by the exponent $\alpha=2-d / 2$. Note that in evaluating the sums appearing in Eqs. (7.49) and (7.53), the lower limit for $\ell$ is not treated very carefully. The series in Eq. (7.49) is assumed to start from $\ell=0$, and that of Eq. (7.53) from $\ell=1$. In fact the first few terms of both series may be zero because the number of steps is not sufficient to reach $\mathbf{0}$ from $\mathbf{r}$, or to form a closed loop. This is not a serious omission, in that the singular behavior of a series is not affected by its first few terms. Treating the first few terms differently can only add analytic corrections to the singular forms calculated in Eqs. (7.49) and (7.53).

The equivalence of these results to the Gaussian model is a manifestation of field-particle duality. In a field theoretical description, (imaginary) time appears as an additional dimension, and the two-point correlations describe the probability of propagating a particle from one point in space-time to another. In a wave description, this probability is calculated by evolving the wave function using the Schrödinger equation. Alternatively, the probability can be calculated as the sum over all (Feynman) paths connecting the two points, each path weighted with the correct action. The second sum is similar to the above calculation of $\langle\sigma(\mathbf{r}) \sigma(\mathbf{0})\rangle$.

This approach provides an interesting geometrical interpretation of the phase transition. The establishment of long-range order implies that all parts of the system have selected the same state. This information is carried by the bonds connecting nearest neighbors, and can be passed from the origin to a point $\mathbf{r}$, through all paths connecting these two points. The fugacity $t$ is a measure of the reliability of information transfer between neighboring sites. Along a one-dimensional chain, unless $t=1$, the transferred information decays at
large distances and it is impossible to establish long-range order. In higher dimensions there are many more paths, and by accumulating the information from all paths it is possible to establish order at $t_{c}<1$. Since the number of paths of length $\ell$ grows as $(2 d)^{\ell}$ while their information content decays as $t^{\ell}$, the transition occurs at $t_{c}=1 /(2 d)$. (A better approximation is obtained by including some of the constraints by noting that the random walk cannot back track. In this case the number of walks grows as $(2 d-1)^{\ell}$.) The total information from paths of length $\ell$ is weighted by $(2 d t)^{\ell}$, and decays exponentially for $t<t_{c}$. The characteristic path length, $\bar{\ell}=-1 / \ln (2 d t)$, diverges as $\left(t_{c}-t\right)^{-1}$ on approaching the transition. For paths of size $\ell \ll \bar{\ell}$ there is very good information transfer. Such paths execute random walks on the lattice and cover a distance $\xi \approx \bar{\ell}^{1 / 2}$. The divergence of $\nu$ with an exponent of $1 / 2$ is thus a consequence of the random walk nature of the paths.

Why does the classical picture fail for $d \leq 4$ ? Let us focus on the dominant paths close to the phase transition. Is it justified to ignore the intersections of such paths? Random walks can be regarded as geometrical entities of fractal (Hausdorf) dimension $d_{f}=2$. This follows from the general definition of dimension relating the mass and extent of an object by $M \propto R^{d_{f}}$, and the observation that the size of a random walk $(R \propto \xi)$ is the square root of its length $(M \propto \ell)$. Two geometrical entities of dimensions $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ will generally intersect in $d$-dimensional space if $d_{1}+d_{2} \geq d$. Thus our random walkers are unlikely to intersect in $d \geq d_{u}=2+2=4$, and the above (Gaussian) results obtained by neglecting the intersections are asymptotically valid. Below the upper critical dimension of 4 , random walks have frequent encounters and their intersections must be treated correctly. The diagrams obtained in the perturbative calculation of the propagator with $u m^{4}$ correspond precisely to taking into account the intersections of paths. (Each factor of $u$ corresponds to one intersection.) It is now clear that the constraint of self-avoidance will swell the paths beyond their random walk size leading to an increase in the exponent $\nu$. Below the transition the length of paths grows without bound and the self-avoiding constraint is necessary to ensure the stability of the system.

As demonstrated in the problem section, the loop expansion is easily generalized to $n$-component spins. The only difference is that each closed loop now contributes a factor of $n$. In the phantom limit, where intersections are ignored, the free energy (Eq. 7.53) is simply multiplied by $n$, while the correlation function is left unchanged (precisely as in the Gaussian model). Corrections due to intersections, which modify critical behavior in $d<4$, now depend on $n$. For example, in correcting the two point correlation function, we have to subtract contributions from the self-intersections of the random walk, as well as from contacts with loops (which have a fugacity of $n$ ). The correspondence with the perturbative series of the propagator with a nonlinearity $u(\vec{m} \cdot \vec{m})^{2}$ is again apparent.

Fig. 7.14 The single high temperature graph on the left with an intersection point can be generated by the three random walks on the right.

### 7.7 Exact free energy of the square lattice Ising model

As indicated in Eq. (7.35), the Ising partition function is related to a sum $S$, over collections of paths on the lattice. The allowed graphs for a square lattice have two or four bonds per site. Each bond can appear only once in each graph, contributing a factor of $t \equiv \tanh K$. While it is tempting to replace $S$ with the exactly calculable sum $S^{\prime}$, of all phantom loops of random walks on the lattice, this leads to an overestimation of $S$. The differences between the two sums arise from intersections of random walks, and can be divided into two categories:
(a) There is an over-counting of graphs which intersect at a site, i.e. with four bonds through a point. Consider a graph composed of two loops meeting at a site. Since a walker entering the intersection has three choices, this graph can be represented by three distinct random walks. One choice leads to two disconnected loops; the other two are single loops with or without a self-crossing in the walker's path.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-151.jpg?height=118&width=709&top_left_y=1062&top_left_x=757)
(b) The independent random walkers in $S^{\prime}$ may go through a particular lattice bond more than once.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-151.jpg?height=200&width=747&top_left_y=1591&top_left_x=738)

Including these constraints amounts to introducing interactions between paths. The resulting interacting random walkers are non-Markovian, as each step is no longer independent of previous ones and of other walkers. While such interacting walks are not in general amenable to exact treatment, in two dimensions an interesting topological property allows us to make the following assertion:

$$
\begin{align*}
S= & \sum \text { collections of loops of random walks with no U-turns } \\
& \times t^{\text {number of bonds }} \times(-1)^{\text {number of crossings. }} \tag{7.55}
\end{align*}
$$

The negative signs for some terms reduce the overestimate and render the exact sum.

Justification We shall deal in turn with the two problems mentioned above.
(a) Consider a graph with many intersections and focus on a particular one. A walker must enter and leave such an intersection twice. This can be done in three ways, only one of which involves the path of the walker crossing itself (when the walker proceeds straight through the intersection twice). This configuration carries an additional factor of $(-1)$ according to Eq. (7.55). Thus, independent of other crossings, these three configurations sum up to contribute a factor of 1 . By repeating this reasoning at each intersection, we see that the over-counting problem is removed and the sum over all possible ways of tracing the graph leads to the correct factor of one.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-152.jpg?height=120&width=640&top_left_y=1175&top_left_x=426)
(b) Consider a bond that is crossed by two walkers (or twice by the same walker). We can imagine the bond as an avenue with two sides. For each configuration in which the two paths enter and leave on the same side of the avenue, there is another one in which the paths go to the opposite side. The latter involves a crossing of paths and hence carries a minus sign with respect to the former. The two possibilities thus cancel out! The reasoning can be generalized to multiple passes through any bond. The only exception is when the double bond is created as a result of a U-turn. This is why such backward steps are explicitly excluded from Eq. (7.55).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-152.jpg?height=51&width=550&top_left_y=1917&top_left_x=471)

Fig. 7.16 The intersection point can be traversed in three ways, with the last carrying a relative factor of (-1).

Fig. 7.17 The two ways of traversing a doubly crossed bond carry opposite factors and cancel out.

Fig. 7.18 Two examples of canceling random walk loops.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-153.jpg?height=231&width=493&top_left_y=260&top_left_x=860)

Let us label random walkers with no U-turns, and weighted by $(-1)^{\text {number of crossings }}$, as $\mathrm{RW}^{*}$. Then as in Eq. (7.37) the terms in $S$ can be organized as

$$
\begin{align*}
S & =\sum\left(\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s} \text { with } 1 \text { loop }\right)+\sum\left(\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s} \text { with } 2 \text { loops }\right)+\sum\left(\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s} \text { with } 3 \text { loops }\right)+\cdots \\
& =\exp \left[\sum\left(\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s} \text { with } 1 \text { loop }\right)\right] \tag{7.56}
\end{align*}
$$

The exponentiation of the sum is justified, since the only interaction between $\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s}$ is the sign related to their crossings. As two RW* loops always cross an even number of times, this is equivalent to no interaction at all. Using Eq. (7.35), the full Ising free energy is calculated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln Z=N \ln 2+2 N \ln \cosh K+\sum\left(\mathrm{RW}^{*} \mathrm{~s} \text { with } 1 \text { loop } \times t^{\# \text { of bonds }}\right) \tag{7.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

Organizing the sum in terms of the number of bonds, and taking advantage of the translational symmetry of the lattice (up to corrections due to boundaries),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)+\sum_{\ell}^{\infty} \frac{t^{\ell}}{\ell}\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle \tag{7.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle= & \text { number of closed loops of } \ell \text { steps, with no U-turns, } \\
& \text { from } \mathbf{0} \text { to } \mathbf{0} \times(-1)^{\#} \text { of crossings } \tag{7.59}
\end{align*}
$$

The absence of U-turns, a local constraint, does not complicate the counting of loops. On the other hand, the number of crossings is a function of the complete configuration of the loop and is a non-Markovian property. Fortunately, in two dimensions it is possible to obtain the parity of the number of crossings from local considerations. The first step is to construct the loops from directed random walks, indicated by placing an arrow along the direction that the path is traversed. Since any loop can be traversed in two directions,

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle= & \frac{1}{2} \sum \text { directed } \mathrm{RW}^{*} \text { loops of } \ell \text { steps, no U-turns, } \\
& \text { from } \mathbf{0} \text { to } \mathbf{0} \times(-1)^{n_{c}} \tag{7.60}
\end{align*}
$$

where $n_{c}$ is the number of self-crossings of the loop. We can now take advantage of the following topological result:

Whitney's theorem: The number of self-crossings of a planar loop is related to the total angle $\Theta$, through which the tangent vector turns in going around the loop by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(n_{c}\right)_{\bmod 2}=\left(1+\frac{\Theta}{2 \pi}\right)_{\bmod 2} \tag{7.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

This theorem can be checked by a few examples. A single loop corresponds to $\Theta= \pm 2 \pi$, while a single intersection results in $\Theta=0$.

Fig. 7.19 Illustration of Whitney's theorem: The angle of the tangent vector on traversing each closed loop is plotted below it. The net angle can be related to the number of crossings.

Since the total angle $\Theta$ is the sum of the angles through which the walker turns at each step, the parity of crossings can be obtained using local information alone as

$$
\begin{equation*}
(-1)^{n_{c}}=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \pi n_{c}}=\exp \left[\mathrm{i} \pi\left(1+\frac{\Theta}{2 \pi}\right)\right]=-\mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} \theta_{j}} \tag{7.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\theta_{j}$ is the angle through which the walker turns on the $j$ th step, leading to
$\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=-\frac{1}{2} \sum$ directed $\mathrm{RW}^{*}$ loops of $\ell$ steps, with no U-turns,
from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{0} \times \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \sum\right.$ local change of angle by the tangent vector $)$.

The angle turned can be calculated at each site, if we keep track of the directions of arrival and departure of the path. To this end, we introduce a label

Fig. 7.20 Labeling directions out of a site.
$\mu$ for the four directions going out of each site, e.g. $\mu=1$ for right, $\mu=2$ for up, $\mu=3$ for left, and $\mu=4$ for down. We next introduce a set of $4 N \times 4 N$ matrices generalizing Eq. (7.39) as
$\left\langle x_{2} y_{2}, \mu_{2}\right| W^{*}(\ell)\left|x_{1} y_{1}, \mu_{1}\right\rangle=\sum$ directed random walks of $\ell$ steps, with no $U$-turns, departing $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ along $\mu_{1}$,
proceeding along $\mu_{2}$ after reaching $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right) \times \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} \theta_{j}}$.

Thus $\mu_{2}$ specifies a direction taken after the walker reaches its destination. It serves to exclude some paths (e.g. arriving along $-\mu_{2}$ ), and leads to an additional phase.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_27_3657433bbdebf76e536dg-155.jpg?height=191&width=583&top_left_y=897&top_left_x=815)

As in Eq. (7.43), due to their Markovian property, these matrices can be calculated recursively as

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right| W^{*}(\ell)|x y, \mu\rangle & =\sum_{x^{\prime \prime} y^{\prime \prime}, \mu^{\prime \prime}}\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right| T^{*}\left|x^{\prime \prime} y^{\prime \prime}, \mu^{\prime \prime}\right\rangle\left\langle x^{\prime \prime} y^{\prime \prime}, \mu^{\prime \prime}\right| W^{*}(\ell-1)|x y, \mu\rangle \\
& =\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right| T^{*} W^{*}(\ell-1)|x y, \mu\rangle=\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right| T^{* \ell}|x y, \mu\rangle \tag{7.65}
\end{align*}
$$

where $T^{*} \equiv W^{*}(1)$ describes one step of the walk. The direction of arrival uniquely determines the nearest neighbor from which the walker departed, and the angle between the two directions fixes the phase of the matrix element. We can thus generalize Eq. (7.46) to a $4 \times 4$ matrix that keeps track of both connectivity and phase between pairs of sites. The steps taken can be represented diagrammatically as

$$
T^{*}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\rightarrow & \rightarrow & \rightleftarrows & \downarrow  \tag{7.66}\\
\uparrow & \uparrow & \leftarrow & \uparrow \downarrow \\
& \uparrow & \uparrow & \leftarrow \\
\rightleftarrows & \uparrow \leftarrow & \leftarrow & \downarrow \\
\downarrow & \downarrow \uparrow & \downarrow & \downarrow
\end{array}\right],
$$

and correspond to the matrix

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}\right| T^{*}|x y\rangle= \\
& {\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x+1, y\right\rangle & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x+1, y\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i \pi}{4}} & 0 & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x+1, y\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{i \pi}{4}} \\
\left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y+1\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{i \pi}{4}} & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y+1\right\rangle & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y+1\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i \pi}{4}} & 0 \\
0 & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x-1, y\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{i \pi}{4}} & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x-1, y\right\rangle & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x-1, y\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i \pi}{4}} \\
\left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y-1\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\frac{i \pi}{4}} & 0 & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y-1\right\rangle \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{i \pi}{4}} & \left\langle x^{\prime}, y^{\prime} \mid x, y-1\right\rangle
\end{array}\right],} \tag{7.67}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\left\langle x, y \mid x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}\right\rangle \equiv \delta_{x, x^{\prime}} \delta_{y, y^{\prime}}$.
Because of its translational symmetry, the $4 N \times 4 N$ matrix takes a block diagonal form in the Fourier basis, $\left\langle x y \mid q_{x} q_{y}\right\rangle=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x} x+q_{y} y\right)} / \sqrt{N}$, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{x y}\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right| T^{*}|x y, \mu\rangle\left\langle x y \mid q_{x} q_{y}\right\rangle=\left\langle\mu^{\prime}\right| T^{*}(\mathbf{q})|\mu\rangle\left\langle x^{\prime} y^{\prime} \mid q_{x} q_{y}\right\rangle \tag{7.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

Each $4 \times 4$ block is labeled by a wavevector $\mathbf{q}=\left(q_{x}, q_{y}\right)$, and takes the form

$$
T^{*}(\mathbf{q})=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} q_{x}} & \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 & \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}  \tag{7.69}\\
\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} q_{y}} & \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 \\
0 & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{x}} & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{y}}
\end{array}\right]
$$

To ensure that a path that starts at the origin completes a loop properly, the final arrival direction at the origin must coincide with the original one. Summing over all four such directions, the total number of such loops is obtained from

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=\sum_{\mu=1}^{4}\langle 00, \mu| T^{* \ell}|00, \mu\rangle=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{x y, \mu}\langle x y, \mu| T^{* \ell}|x y, \mu\rangle=\frac{1}{N} \operatorname{tr}\left(T^{* \ell}\right) . \tag{7.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using Eq. (7.58), the free energy is calculated as

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N} & =\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\ell} \frac{t^{\ell}}{\ell}\langle\mathbf{0}| W^{*}(\ell)|\mathbf{0}\rangle=\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)-\frac{1}{2 N} \operatorname{tr}\left[\sum_{\ell} \frac{T^{* \ell} t^{\ell}}{\ell}\right] \\
& =\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)+\frac{1}{2 N} \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(1-t T^{*}\right)  \tag{7.71}\\
& =\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)+\frac{1}{2 N} \sum_{\mathbf{q}} \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(1-t T^{*}(\mathbf{q})\right) .
\end{align*}
$$

But for any matrix $M$ with eigenvalues $\left\{\lambda_{\alpha}\right\}$,

$$
\operatorname{tr} \ln M=\sum_{\alpha} \ln \lambda_{\alpha}=\ln \prod_{\alpha} \lambda_{\alpha}=\ln \operatorname{det} M .
$$

Converting the sum over $\mathbf{q}$ in Eq. (7.71) to an integral leads to

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}= & \ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)+\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \\
& \ln \left\{\operatorname{det}\left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1-t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} q_{x}} & -t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 & -t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
-t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 1-t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} q_{y}} & -t \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 \\
0 & -\mathrm{te}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 1-t \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{x}} & -t \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{x}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
-t \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 0 & -t \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(q_{y}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} & 1-t \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} q_{y}}
\end{array}\right|\right\} . \tag{7.72}
\end{align*}
$$

Evaluation of the above determinant is straightforward, and the final result is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)+\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} \mathbf{q}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \ln \left[\left(1+t^{2}\right)^{2}-2 t\left(1-t^{2}\right)\left(\cos q_{x}+\cos q_{y}\right)\right] \tag{7.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking advantage of trigonometric identities, the result can be simplified to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln 2+\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{\mathrm{d} q_{x} \mathrm{~d} q_{y}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \ln \left[\cosh ^{2}(2 K)-\sinh (2 K)\left(\cos q_{x}+\cos q_{y}\right)\right] \tag{7.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

While it is possible to obtain a closed form expression by performing the integrals exactly, the final expression involves a hypergeometric function, and is not any more illuminating.

### 7.8 Critical behavior of the two-dimensional Ising model

To understand the singularity in the free energy of the two-dimensional Ising model in Eq. (7.73), we start with the simpler expression obtained by the unrestricted sum over phantom loops in Section 7.6. Specializing Eq. (7.53) to $d=2$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{G}=\ln \left(2 \cosh ^{2} K\right)-\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{\mathrm{~d} q_{x} \mathrm{~d} q_{y}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \ln \left[1-2 t\left(\cos q_{x}+\cos q_{y}\right)\right] . \tag{7.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

Apart from the argument of the logarithm, this expression is similar to the exact result. Is it possible that such similar functional forms lead to distinct singular behaviors? The singularity results from the vanishing of the argument of the logarithm at $t_{c}=1 / 4$. In the vicinity of this point we make an expansion as in Eq. (7.50),

$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{G}(t, \mathbf{q})=(1-4 t)+t q^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(q^{4}\right) \approx t_{c}\left(q^{2}+4 \frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right), \tag{7.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\delta t=t_{c}-t$. The singular part of Eq. (7.75) can be obtained by focusing on the behavior of the integrand as $\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}$, and replacing the square Brillouin zone for the range of the integral with a circle of radius $\Lambda \approx 2 \pi$,

$$
\begin{align*}
f_{\text {sing }} & =-\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda} \frac{2 \pi q \mathrm{~d} q}{4 \pi^{2}} \ln \left(q^{2}+4 \frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right) \\
& =-\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left[\left(q^{2}+4 \frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right) \ln \left(\frac{q^{2}+4 \delta t / t_{c}}{e}\right)\right]_{0}^{\Lambda} \tag{7.77}
\end{align*}
$$

Only the expression evaluated at $q=0$ is singular, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
f_{\mathrm{sing}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right) \ln \left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right) \tag{7.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

The resulting heat capacity, $C_{G} \propto \partial^{2} f_{G} / \partial^{2} t$, diverges as $1 / \delta t$. Since Eq. (7.75) is not valid for $t>t_{c}$, we cannot obtain the behavior of heat capacity on the low-temperature side.

For the exact result of Eq. (7.73), the argument of the logarithm is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A^{*}(t, \mathbf{q})=\left(1+t^{2}\right)^{2}-2 t\left(1-t^{2}\right)\left(\cos q_{x}+\cos q_{y}\right) \tag{7.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

The minimum value of this expression, for $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
A^{*}(t, \mathbf{0})=\left(1+t_{c}^{2}\right)^{2}-4 t_{c}\left(1-t_{c}^{2}\right)=\left(1-t_{c}^{2}\right)^{2}+4 t_{c}^{2}-4 t_{c}\left(1-t_{c}^{2}\right)=\left(1-t_{c}^{2}-2 t_{c}\right)^{2} . \tag{7.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since this expression (and hence the argument of the logarithm) is always nonnegative, the integral exists for all values of $t$. As required, unlike Eq. (7.75), the exact result is valid at all temperatures. There is a singularity when the argument vanishes for

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{c}^{2}+2 t_{c}-1=0, \quad \Longrightarrow \quad t_{c}=-1 \pm \sqrt{2} \tag{7.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

The positive solution describes a ferromagnet, and leads to a value of $K_{c}=$ $\ln (\sqrt{2}+1) / 2$, in agreement with the duality arguments of Section 7.4. Setting $\delta t=t-t_{c}$, and expanding Eq. (7.79) in the vicinity of $\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0$ gives

$$
\begin{align*}
A^{*}(t, \mathbf{q}) & \approx\left[\left(-2 t_{c}-2\right) \delta t\right]^{2}+t_{c}\left(1-t_{c}^{2}\right) q^{2}+\cdots \\
& \approx 2 t_{c}^{2}\left[q^{2}+4\left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right)^{2}\right] \tag{7.82}
\end{align*}
$$

The important difference from Eq. (7.76) is that $\left(\delta t / t_{c}\right)$ appears at quadratic order. Following the steps in Eqs. (7.77) and (7.78), the singular part of the free energy is

$$
\begin{align*}
\left.\frac{\ln Z}{N}\right|_{\text {sing }} & =\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda} \frac{2 \pi q \mathrm{~d} q}{4 \pi^{2}} \ln \left[q^{2}+4\left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right)^{2}\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left[\left(q^{2}+4\left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right)^{2}\right) \ln \left(\frac{q^{2}+4\left(\delta t / t_{c}\right)^{2}}{e}\right)\right]_{0}^{\Lambda}  \tag{7.83}\\
& =-\frac{1}{\pi}\left(\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right)^{2} \ln \left|\frac{\delta t}{t_{c}}\right|+\text { analytic terms. }
\end{align*}
$$

The heat capacity is obtained by taking two derivatives and diverges as $C(\delta t)_{\text {sing }}=A_{ \pm} \ln |\delta t|$. The logarithmic singularity corresponds to the limit $\alpha=$ 0 ; the peak is symmetric, characterized by the amplitude ratio $A_{+} / A_{-}=1$.

The exact partition function of the Ising model on the square lattice was originally calculated by Lars Onsager in 1944 (Phys. Rev. 65, 117). Onsager used a $2^{L} \times 2^{L}$ transfer matrix to study a lattice of width $L$. He then identified various symmetries of this matrix which allowed him to diagonalize it and obtain the largest eigenvalue as a function of $L$. For any finite $L$, this eigenvalue is non-degenerate as required by Frobenius' theorem. In the limit $L \rightarrow \infty$, the top two eigenvalues become degenerate at $K_{c}$. The result in this limit naturally coincides with Eq. (7.74). Onsager's paper is quite long and complicated, and regarded as a tour de force of mathematical physics. A somewhat streamlined version of this solution was developed by B. Kaufman (Phys. Rev. 76, 1232 (1949)). The exact solution, for the first time, demonstrated that critical behavior at a phase transition can in fact be quite different from predictions of Landau (mean-field) theory. It took almost three decades to reconcile the two results by the renormalization group.

The graphical method presented in this section was originally developed by Kac and Ward (Phys. Rev. 88, 1332 (1952)). The main ingredient of the derivation is the result that the correct accounting of the paths can be achieved by including a factor of $(-1)$ for each intersection. (This conjecture by Feynman is proved in S. Sherman, J. Math. Phys. 1, 202 (1960).) The change of sign is reminiscent of the exchange factor between fermions. Indeed, Schultz, Mattis, and Lieb (Rev. Mod. Phys. 36, 856 (1964)) describe how the Onsager transfer matrix can be regarded as a Hamiltonian for the evolution of non-interacting fermions in one dimension. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents intersections of the world-lines of these fermions in two dimensional space-time.

In addition to the partition function, the correlation functions $\left\langle\sigma_{\mathbf{i}} \sigma_{\mathbf{j}}\right\rangle$ can also be calculated by summing over paths. Since the combination $q^{2}+4\left(\delta t / t_{c}\right)^{2}$ in Eq. (7.82) describes the behavior of these random walks, we expect a correlation length $\xi \sim\left|t_{c} / \delta t\right|$, i.e. diverging with an exponent $\nu=1$ on both sides of the phase transition with an amplitude ratio of unity. The exponents $\alpha$ and $\nu$ are related by the hyperscaling identity $\alpha=2-2 \nu$. The critical correlations at $t_{c}$ are more subtle and decay as $\left\langle\sigma_{\mathbf{i}} \sigma_{j}\right\rangle_{c} \sim 1 /|\mathbf{i}-\mathbf{j}|^{\eta}$, with $\eta=1 / 4$. Integrating the correlation functions yields the susceptibility, which diverges as $\chi_{ \pm} \simeq C_{ \pm}|\delta t|^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma=7 / 4$, and $C_{+} / C_{-}=1$. A rather simple expression for the zero field magnetization,

$$
\begin{equation*}
m=\left(1-\sinh ^{-4}(2 K)\right)^{1 / 8}, \tag{7.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

was presented without proof by Onsager. A rather difficult derivation of this result was finally given by C.N. Yang (Phys. Rev. 85, 808 (1952)). The exponent $\beta=1 / 8$ satisfies the required exponent identities.

## Problems for chapter 7

1. Continuous spins: In the standard $\mathcal{O}(n)$ model, $n$ component unit vectors are placed on the sites of a lattice. The nearest-neighbor spins are then connected by a bond
   $J \vec{s}_{i} \cdot \vec{s}_{j}$. In fact, if we are only interested in universal properties, any generalized interaction $f\left(\vec{s}_{i} \cdot \vec{s}_{j}\right)$ leads to the same critical behavior. By analogy with the Ising model, a suitable choice is

$$
\exp \left[f\left(\vec{s}_{i} \cdot \vec{s}_{j}\right)\right]=1+(n t) \vec{s}_{i} \cdot \vec{s}_{j}
$$

resulting in the so called loop model.
(a) Construct a high temperature expansion of the loop model (for the partition function $Z$ ) in the parameter $t$, on a two-dimensional hexagonal (honeycomb) lattice.
(b) Show that the limit $n \rightarrow 0$ describes the configurations of a single self-avoiding polymer on the lattice.

2. Potts model I: Consider Potts spins $s_{i}=(1,2, \cdots, q)$, interacting via the Hamiltonian $-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} \delta_{s_{i}, s_{j}}$.
   (a) To treat this problem graphically at high temperatures, the Boltzmann weight for each bond is written as

$$
\exp \left(K \delta_{s_{i}, s_{j}}\right)=C(K)\left[1+T(K) g\left(s_{i}, s_{j}\right)\right]
$$

with $g\left(s, s^{\prime}\right)=q \delta_{s, s^{\prime}}-1$. Find $C(K)$ and $T(K)$.
(b) Show that

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sum_{s=1}^{q} g\left(s, s^{\prime}\right)=0, \quad \sum_{s=1}^{q} g\left(s_{1}, s\right) g\left(s, s_{2}\right)=q g\left(s_{1}, s_{2}\right) \\
\text { and } \sum_{s, s^{\prime}}^{q} g\left(s, s^{\prime}\right) g\left(s^{\prime}, s\right)=q^{2}(q-1)
\end{gathered}
$$

(c) Use the above results to calculate the free energy, and the correlation function $\left\langle g\left(s_{m}, s_{n}\right)\right\rangle$ for a one-dimensional chain.
(d) Calculate the partition function on the square lattice to order of $T^{4}$. Also calculate the first term in the low-temperature expansion of this problem.
(e) By comparing the first terms in low- and high-temperature series, find a duality rule for Potts models. Don't worry about higher order graphs, they will work out! Assuming a single transition temperature, find the value of $K_{c}(q)$.
(f) How do the higher order terms in the high-temperature series for the Potts model differ from those of the Ising model? What is the fundamental difference that sets apart the graphs for $q=2$ ? (This is ultimately the reason why only the Ising model is solvable.)

3. Potts model II: An alternative expansion is obtained by starting with

$$
\exp \left[K \delta\left(s_{i}, s_{j}\right)\right]=1+v(K) \delta\left(s_{i}, s_{j}\right)
$$

where $v(K)=\mathrm{e}^{K}-1$. In this case, the sum over spins does not remove any graphs, and all choices of distributing bonds at random on the lattice are acceptable.
(a) Including a magnetic field $h \sum_{i} \delta_{s_{i},}$, show that the partition function takes the form

$$
Z(q, K, h)=\sum_{\text {all graphs }} \prod_{\text {clusters c in graph }}\left[v^{c_{b}^{c}} \times\left(q-1+\mathrm{e}^{h n_{s}^{c}}\right)\right],
$$

where $n_{b}^{c}$ and $n_{s}^{c}$ are the numbers of bonds and sites in cluster $c$. This is known as the random cluster expansion.
(b) Show that the limit $q \rightarrow 1$ describes a percolation problem, in which bonds are randomly distributed on the lattice with probability $p=v /(v+1)$. What is the percolation threshold on the square lattice?
(c) Show that in the limit $q \rightarrow 0$, only a single connected cluster contributes to leading order. The enumeration of all such clusters is known as listing branched lattice animals.

4. Ising model in a field: Consider the partition function for the Ising model $\left(\sigma_{i}= \pm 1\right)$ on a square lattice, in a magnetic field $h$; i.e.

$$
Z=\sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}} \exp \left[K \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}+h \sum_{i} \sigma_{i}\right] .
$$

(a) Find the general behavior of the terms in a low-temperature expansion for $Z$.
(b) Think of a model whose high-temperature series reproduces the generic behavior found in (a); and hence obtain the Hamiltonian, and interactions of the dual model.

5. Potts duality: Consider Potts spins, $s_{i}=(1,2, \cdots, q)$, placed on the sites of a square lattice of $N$ sites, interacting with their nearest-neighbors through a Hamiltonian

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} \delta_{s_{i}, s_{j}}
$$

(a) By comparing the first terms of high and low temperature series, or by any other method, show that the partition function has the property

$$
Z(K)=q \mathrm{e}^{2 N K} \Xi\left[\mathrm{e}^{-K}\right]=q^{-N}\left[\mathrm{e}^{K}+q-1\right]^{2 N} \Xi\left[\frac{\mathrm{e}^{K}-1}{\mathrm{e}^{K}+(q-1)}\right],
$$

for some function $\Xi$, and hence locate the critical point $K_{c}(q)$.
(b) Starting from the duality expression for $Z(K)$, derive a similar relation for the internal energy $U(K)=\langle\beta \mathcal{H}\rangle=-\partial \ln Z / \partial \ln K$. Use this to calculate the exact value of $U$ at the critical point.

6. Anisotropic random walks: Consider the ensemble of all random walks on a square lattice starting at the origin $(0,0)$. Each walk has a weight of $t_{x}^{\ell_{x}} \times t_{y}{ }^{\ell_{y}}$, where $\ell_{x}$ and $\ell_{y}$ are the number of steps taken along the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.
   (a) Calculate the total weight $W(x, y)$, of all walks terminating at $(x, y)$. Show that $W$ is well defined only for $\bar{t}=\left(t_{x}+t_{y}\right) / 2<t_{c}=1 / 4$.
   (b) What is the shape of a curve $W(x, y)=$ constant, for large $x$ and $y$, and close to the transition?
   (c) How does the average number of steps, $\langle\ell\rangle=\left\langle\ell_{x}+\ell_{y}\right\rangle$, diverge as $\bar{t}$ approaches $t_{c}$ ?
7. Anisotropic ising model: Consider the anisotropic Ising model on a square lattice with a Hamiltonian

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=\sum_{x, y}\left(K_{x} \sigma_{x, y} \sigma_{x+1, y}+K_{y} \sigma_{x, y} \sigma_{x, y+1}\right) ;
$$

i.e. with bonds of different strengths along the $x$ and $y$ directions.
(a) By following the method presented in the text, calculate the free energy for this model. You do not have to write down every step of the derivation. Just sketch the steps that need to be modified due to anisotropy; and calculate the final answer for $\ln Z / N$.
(b) Find the critical boundary in the ( $K_{x}, K_{y}$ ) plane from the singularity of the free energy. Show that it coincides with the condition $K_{x}=\tilde{K}_{y}$, where $\tilde{K}$ indicates the standard dual interaction to $K$.
(c) Find the singular part of $\ln Z / N$, and comment on how anisotropy affects critical behavior in the exponent and amplitude ratios.

8. Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz estimate of the interfacial energy of the $d=2$ Ising model on a square lattice:

   (a) Consider an interface on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions in one direction. Ignoring islands and overhangs, the configurations can be labelled by heights $h_{n}$ for $1 \leq n \leq L$. Show that for an ansiotropic Ising model of interactions ( $K_{x}, K_{y}$ ), the energy of an interface along the $x$-direction is

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=-2 K_{y} L-2 K_{x} \sum_{n}\left|h_{n+1}-h_{n}\right| .
$$

(b) Write down a column-to-column transfer matrix $\langle h| T\left|h^{\prime}\right\rangle$, and diagonalize it.
(c) Obtain the interface free energy using the result in (b), or by any other method.
(d) Find the condition between $K_{x}$ and $K_{y}$ for which the interfacial free energy vanishes. Does this correspond to the critical boundary of the original 2d Ising model as computed in the previous problem?

9. Anisotropic Landau theory: Consider an $n$-component magnetization field $\vec{m}(\mathbf{x})$ in $d$-dimensions.
   (a) Using the previous problems on anisotropy as a guide, generalize the standard Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian to include the effects of spacial anisotropy.
   (b) Are such anisotropies "relevant"?
   (c) In $\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{CuO}_{4}$, the Cu atoms are arranged on the sites of a square lattice in planes, and the planes are then stacked together. Each Cu atom carries a "spin", which we assume to be classical, and can point along any direction in space. There is a very strong antiferromagnetic interaction in each plane. There is also a very weak interplane interaction that prefers to align successive layers. Sketch the low-temperature magnetic phase, and indicate to what universality class the order-disorder transition belongs.
10. Energy by duality: Consider the Ising model $\left(\sigma_{i}= \pm 1\right)$ on a square lattice with $-\beta \mathcal{H}=K \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}$.
    (a) Starting from the duality expression for the free energy, derive a similar relation for the internal energy $U(K)=\langle H\rangle=-\partial \ln Z / \partial \ln K$.
    (b) Using (a), calculate the exact value of $U$ at the critical point $K_{c}$.
11. Clock model duality: Consider spins $s_{i}=(1,2, \cdots, q)$ placed on the sites of a square lattice, interacting via the clock model Hamiltonian

$$
\beta \mathcal{H}_{C}=-\sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} J\left(\left|s_{i}-s_{j}\right|_{\bmod q}\right)
$$

(a) Change from the $N$ site variables to the $2 N$ bond variables $b_{i j}=s_{i}-s_{j}$. Show that the difference in the number of variables can be accounted for by the constraint that around each plaquette (elementary square) the sum of the four bond variables must be zero modulus $q$.
(b) The constraints can be implemented by adding "delta-functions"

$$
\delta\left[S_{p}\right]_{\bmod q}=\frac{1}{q} \sum_{n_{p}=1}^{q} \exp \left[\frac{2 \pi \mathrm{i} n_{p} S_{p}}{q}\right],
$$

for each plaquette. Show that after summing over the bond variables, the partition function can be written in terms of the dual variables, as

$$
Z=q^{-N} \sum_{\left\{n_{p}\right\}} \prod_{\left\langle p, p^{\prime}\right\rangle} \lambda\left(n_{p}-n_{p^{\prime}}\right) \equiv \sum_{\left\{n_{p}\right\}} \exp \left[\sum_{\left\langle p, p^{\prime}\right\rangle} \tilde{J}\left(n_{p}-n_{p^{\prime}}\right)\right],
$$

where $\lambda(k)$ is the discrete Fourier transform of $\mathrm{e}^{J(n)}$.
(c) Calculate the dual interaction parameter of a Potts model, and hence locate the critical point $J_{c}(q)$.
(d) Construct the dual of the anisotropic Potts model, with

$$
-\beta \mathcal{H}=\sum_{x, y}\left(J_{x} \delta_{s_{x, y}, s_{x+1, y}}+J_{y} \delta_{s_{x, y}, s_{x, y+1}}\right)
$$

i.e. with bonds of different strengths along the $x$ and $y$ directions. Find the line of self-dual interactions in the plane $\left(J_{x}, J_{y}\right)$.

12. Triangular/hexagonal lattices: For any planar network of bonds, one can define a geometrical dual by connecting the centers of neighboring plaquettes. Each bond of the dual lattice crosses a bond of the original lattice, allowing for a local mapping. Clearly, the dual of a triangular lattice is a hexagonal (or honeycomb) lattice, and vice versa.
    (a) Starting from a Potts model with nearest-neighbor interaction $J$ on the triangular lattice, find the interaction parameter $J_{h}(J)$ of the dual hexagonal lattice.
    (b) Note that the hexagonal lattice is bipartite, i.e. can be separated into two sublattices. In the partition function, do a partial sum over all spins in one sublattice. Show that the remaining spins form a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions $\tilde{J}(J)$, and a three spin interaction $\tilde{J}_{3}(J)$. (This is called the startriangle transformation.) Why is $\tilde{J}_{3}$ absent in the Ising model?
    (c) Clearly, the model is not self-dual due to the additional interaction. Nonetheless, obtain the critical value such that $\tilde{J}\left(J_{c}\right)=J_{c}$.
    (d) Check that $\tilde{J}_{3}\left(J_{c}\right)=0$, i.e. while the model in general is not self-dual, it is self-dual right at criticality, leading to the exact value of $J_{c}(q)$ !
13. Cubic lattice: The geometric concept of duality can be extended to general dimensions $d$. However, the dual of a geometric element of dimension $D$ is an entity of dimension $d-D$. For example, the dual of a bond $(D=1)$ in $d=3$ is a plaquette ( $D=2$ ), as demonstrated in this problem.
    (a) Consider a clock model on a cubic lattice of $N$ points. Change to the $3 N$ bond variables $b_{i j}=s_{i}-s_{j}$. (Note that one must make a convention about the positive directions on the three axes.) Show that there are now $2 N$ constraints associated with the plaquettes of this lattice.
    (b) Implement the constraints through discrete delta-functions by associating an auxiliary variable $n_{p}$ with each plaquette. It is useful to imagine $n_{p}$ as defined on a bond of the dual lattice, perpendicular to the plaquette $p$.
    (c) By summing over the bond variables in $Z$, obtain the dual Hamiltonian

$$
\tilde{\beta \mathcal{H}}=\sum_{p} \tilde{J}\left(n_{12}^{p}-n_{23}^{p}+n_{34}^{p}-n_{41}^{p}\right),
$$

where the sum is over all plaquettes $p$ of the dual lattice, with $\left\{n_{i j}^{p}\right\}$ indicating the four bonds around plaquette $p$.
(d) Note that $\tilde{\beta \mathcal{H}}$ is left invariant if all the six bonds going out of any site are simultaneously increased by the same integer. Thus unlike the original model which only had a global translation symmetry, the dual model has a local, i.e. gauge symmetry.
(e) Consider a Potts gauge theory defined on the plaquettes of a four-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Find its critical coupling $J_{c}(q)$.

## Percolation

Fluids do not pass through a solid with a small concentration of holes. However, beyond a threshold concentration, the holes overlap, and the fluid can percolate through a connected channel in the material. Percolation is a classical geometric phase transition, and has been used as a model of many breakdown or failure processes. The loss of rigidity in an elastic network, conductivity in resistor nets, and magnetization in diluted magnets are but a few examples.

In simple models of percolation, elements of a lattice (sites or bonds) are independently occupied with a probability $p$. A cluster is defined as a connected (by neighboring bonds) set of these occupied elements. At small $p$, only small clusters exist, and the probability that two sites, separated by a distance $r$, are connected to each other decays as $\exp (-r / \xi)$. The correlation length $\xi(p)$ grows with increasing $p$, diverging at the percolation threshold $p_{c}$ as $\xi(p) \sim\left|p_{c}-p\right|^{-\nu}$. An infinite cluster first appears at this threshold, and percolates through the (infinite) system for all $p>p_{c}$. The analog of the order parameter is the probability $P(p)$ that a site belongs to this infinite cluster. On approaching $p_{c}$ from above, it vanishes as $P(p) \sim\left|p_{c}-p\right|^{\beta}$. While the value of $p_{c}$ depends on the details of the model, the exponents $\beta$ and $\nu$ are universal, varying only with the spatial dimension $d$.

In the following problems we shall focus on bond percolation, i.e. $p$ denotes the probability that a bond on the lattice is occupied.

14. Cayley trees: Consider a hierarchical lattice in which each site at one level is connected to $z$ sites at the level below. Thus the $n$-th level of the tree has $z^{n}$ sites.
    (a) For $z=2$, obtain a recursion relation for the probability $P_{n}(p)$ that the top site of a tree of $n$ levels is connected to some site at the bottom level.
    (b) Find the limiting behavior of $P(p)$ for infinitely many levels, and give the exponent $\beta$ for this tree.
    (c) In a mean-field approximation, $P(p)$ for a lattice of coordination number $z$ is calculated self-consistently, in a manner similar to the above. Give the mean-field estimates for $p_{c}$ and the exponent $\beta$.
    (d) The one-dimensional chain corresponds to $z=1$. Find the probability that endpoints of an open chain of $N+1$ sites are connected, and hence deduce the correlation length $\xi$.
15. Duality has a very natural interpretation in percolation: If a bond is occupied, its dual is empty, and vice versa. Thus the occupation probability for dual bonds is $\tilde{p}=1-p \equiv q$. Since, by construction, the original and dual elements do not intersect, one or the other percolates through the system.
    (a) The dual of a chain in which $N$ bonds are connected in series has $N$ bonds connected in parallel. What is the corresponding (non-) percolation probability?
    (b) The bond percolation problem on a square lattice is self-dual. What is its threshold $p_{c}$ ?
    (c) Bond percolation in three dimensions is dual to plaquette percolation. This is why in $d=3$ it is possible to percolate while maintaining solid integrity.
    (d) The triangular and hexagonal lattices are dual to each other. Combined with the star-triangle transformation that also maps the two lattices, this leads to exact values of $p_{c}$ for these lattices. However, this calculation is not trivial, and it is best to follow the steps for calculations of the critical couplings of $q$-state Potts models in an earlier problem.
16. Position-space renormalization group (PSRG): In the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation, a decimation is performed after bonds are moved to connect the remaining sites in a one-dimensional geometry. For a PSRG rescaling factor $b$ on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice, the retained sites are connected by $b^{d-1}$ strands in parallel, each strand having $b$ bonds in series. This scheme is naturally exact for $d=1$, and becomes progressively worse in higher dimensions.
    (a) Apply the above scheme to $b=d=2$, and compare the resulting estimates of $p_{c}$ and $y_{t}=1 / \nu$ to the exact values for the square lattice ( $p_{c}=1 / 2$ and $y_{t}=3 / 4$ ).
    (b) Find the limiting values of $p_{c}$ and $y_{t}$ for large $d$. (It can be shown that $\nu=1 / 2$ exactly, above an upper critical dimension $d_{u}=6$.)
    (c) In an alternative PSRG scheme, first $b^{d-1}$ bonds are connected in parallel, the resulting groups are then joined in series. Repeat the above calculations with this scheme.
