## FIELD THEORIES OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS

Presenting the physics of the most challenging problems in condensed matter using the conceptual framework of quantum field theory, this book is of great interest to physicists in condensed matter and high-energy and string theorists, as well as to mathematicians. Revised and updated, this second edition features new chapters on the renormalization group, the Luttinger liquid, gauge theory, topological fluids, topological insulators, and quantum entanglement.

The book begins with the basic concepts and tools, developing them gradually to bring readers to the issues currently faced at the frontiers of research, such as topological phases of matter, quantum and classical critical phenomena, quantum Hall effects, and superconductors. Other topics covered include one-dimensional strongly correlated systems, quantum ordered and disordered phases, topological structures in condensed matter and in field theory and fractional statistics.

Eduardo Fradkin is a Professor in the Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research interests are in condensed matter physics; disordered systems, high-temperature superconductors, and electronic liquid-crystal phases of strongly correlated systems; quantum Hall fluids and other topological phases of matter; and quantum field theory in condensed matter.

## Preface to the second edition

I am extremely happy to, at long last, be able to present the second edition of this book. In spite of what I stated in the preface of the 1991 edition, I ended up not only writing a second edition but, in a sense, a new book. So one can say, once again, that we have met the enemy and it is us. I have been pleased that the 1991 edition of this book was appreciated by many people who found it useful and stimulating. I am really happy that my effort was not in vain.

My motivation for writing this book, in 1991 and now, was to present quantum field theory as a conceptual framework to understand problems in condensed matter physics that cannot be described perturbatively, and hence do not admit a straightforward reduction to some non-interacting problem. In essence, almost all interesting problems in condensed matter physics have this character. Two prime examples of problems of this type in condensed matter physics that developed in the late 1980s, and even more so in the 1990s, are the understanding of high-temperature superconductors and the quantum Hall effects. In both areas field theory played (and plays) a central role. If anything, the use of these ideas has become widespread and increasingly plays a key role. It was lucky that the first edition of this book appeared at just about the right time, even though this meant that I had to miss out on research that was and still is important. This was probably the only time that I was on time, as people who know me can relate. Much has happened since the first edition appeared in print. The problem of the quantum Hall effects has developed into a full-fledged framework to understand topological phases of matter. Although it is still an unsolved problem, the research in high-temperature superconductors (and similar problems) has motivated theorists to look for new ways to think of these problems, and the ideas of quantum field theory have played a central role. The concepts, and subtleties, of gauge theory have come to play a key role in many areas, particularly in frustrated quantum magnetism. The interactions between condensed matter and other areas of physics, particularly high-energy physics and string theory, have become more
important. Concepts in topology and other areas of mathematics rarely frequented by condensed matter physicists have also entered the field with full force. More recent developments have seen the incorporation of ideas of general relativity and quantum entanglement into the field.

These developments motivated me to work on a second edition of this book. I have to thank Simon Capelin, my editor from Cambridge University Press, who took the time to persuade me that this was not a foolish project. So, some time in 2007 (I think) I finally agreed to do it. Of course, this was a more complex project than I had expected (nothing new there!). For this reason it took until now, the Spring of 2012, for me to finish what I thought would take just one year (or so). I wish to thank Simon Capelin and the people at Cambridge University Press for working with me throughout this project.

This second edition contains essentially all that was included in the ten chapters of the first edition, with a substantial editing of misprints and "misprints." However, it has grown to have seven more chapters to incorporate some important material that I left out in 1991 and to add new material to reflect some of the new developments. The result is that this is essentially a new book. I hope that in the process of writing this second edition I have not ruined what was good in the first one, and that the new material will be useful to a wide spectrum of people, not only in condensed matter. Although the book is significantly larger than its first edition, I had to leave out some really important material. In particular, I incorporated hardly any discussion of Fermi liquids, non-Fermi liquids (except for Luttinger liquids), and superconductors, among many important problems that are also of interest to me.

Several notable books that cover some parts of the material I cover have appeared in print since 1991, such as Xiao-Gang Wen's Quantum Field Theory of Many Body Systems (published in 2003) and Subir Sachdev's Quantum Phase Transitions (published in 1999). Other books that cover some aspects of the material are Assa Auerbach's Interacting Electrons and Magnetism (published in 1994) and the book by A. Gogolin, A. Nersesyan, and A. Tsvelik, Bosonization and Strongly Correlated Systems (published in 2004), as well as the superb Principles on Condensed Matter Physics by Paul Chaikin and Tom Lubensky (published in 1995) and John Cardy's Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics (published in 1996).

I am deeply indebted to many people whose work has influenced my views. I have to particularly thank Steve Kivelson for his long-term friendship and collaboration, which has had a strong impact on my work, as reflected here. I also thank my collaborators in many projects, some of which are reflected here, Chetan Nayak, Claudio Chamon, Paul Fendley, Shivaji Sondhi, Joel Moore, and Fidel Schaposnik. I am also indebted to Lenny Susskind and Steve Shenker, who played a great role during my formative years as a theorist and whose outlook has strongly influenced these pages. I also thank my former students Ana López, Christopher Mudry,

Antonio Castro Neto, Eun-Ah Kim, Michael Lawler, Kai Sun, and Benjamin Hsu, whose work is also reflected here. I am also indebted to my colleagues Mike Stone and Rob Leigh, with whom I collaborated in several projects and had countless stimulating discussions. Their work has strongly influenced my own. I also wish to thank Taylor Hughes and Shinsei Ryu for explaining their work (and others) on topological insulators, and motivating me to think on these problems. I am also grateful to Pouyan Ghaemi for reading the chapter on topological insulators and catching several misprints, and to Rodrigo Soto Garrido and to Ponnuraj Krishnakumar for proofreading the entire book and for their great help in generating the skyrmion figures for the cover.

I must also acknowledge the constant and permanent support of the Department of Physics of the University of Illinois, and my colleagues in our department. Some of the material presented here was also used in several special-topics courses I taught in Urbana over the years. I am particularly grateful to Professor Dale van Harlingen, our Department Head, for his constant support. I also wish to thank the many people who over the years have pointed out to me several conceptual issues present in the first edition as well as numerous misprints. I hope the editing of the second edition is substantially better than that of the first. I also wish to thank the National Science Foundation, which supported my research for many years.

This second edition, much like the first, could not have existed without the emotional support and love of Claudia, my wife and lifetime companion. Our children have fortunately (for them) been spared this second edition, which also could not have existed without my father constantly asking when I was going to be done with it.

## Preface to the first edition

This volume is an outgrowth of the course "Physics of Strongly Correlated Systems" which I taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the Fall of 1989. The goal of my course was to present the field-theoretic picture of the most interesting problems in Condensed Matter Physics, in particular those relevant to high-temperature superconductors. The content of the first six chapters is roughly what I covered in that class. The remaining four chapters were developed after January 1, 1990. Thus, that material is largely the culprit for this book being one year late! During 1990 I had to constantly struggle between finalizing the book and doing research that I just could not pass on. The result is that the book is one year late and I was late on every single paper that I thought was important! Thus, I have to agree with the opinion voiced so many times by other people who made the same mistake I did and say, don't ever write a book! Nevertheless, although the experience had its moments of satisfaction, none was like today's when I am finally done with it.

This book exists because of the physics I learned from so many people, but it is only a pale reflection of what I learned from them. I must thank my colleague Michael Stone, from whom I have learned so much. I am also indebted to Steven Kivelson, Fidel Schaposnik, and Xiao-Gang Wen, who not only informed me on many of the subjects which are discussed here but, also, more importantly, did not get too angry with me for not writing the papers I still owe them.

This book would not have existed either without the extraordinary help of Christopher Mudry, Carlos Cassanello, and Ana López, who took time off their research to help me with this crazy project. They have done an incredible job in reading the manuscript, finding my many mistakes (not just typos!), making very useful comments, and helping me with the editing of the final version. I am particularly indebted to Christopher, who made very important remarks and comments concerning the presentation of very many subjects discussed here. He also generated the figures. Mrs. Phyllis Shelton-Ball typeset the first six chapters. My wife,

Claudia, made this project possible by learning $\mathrm{LAT}_{\mathrm{E}} \mathrm{X}$ at great speed and typesetting the last four chapters, correcting some of my very boring and awkward writing style.

This book was also made possible by the love and help of my children Ana, Andrés, and Alejandro, who had to live with a father who became a ghost for a while. Ana and Andrés helped in the proofreading, and took care of their little brother, who helped by keeping everybody happy.

Finally, I must acknowledge the support of the Department of Physics and the Center for Advanced Study of the University of Illinois. The help and understanding of the staff at Addison Wesley is also gratefully acknowledged.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Field theory and condensed matter physics

Condensed matter physics is a very rich and diverse field. If we are to define it as being "whatever gets published in the condensed matter section of a physics journal," we would conclude that it ranges from problems typical of material science to subjects as fundamental as particle physics and cosmology. Because of its diversity, it is sometimes hard to figure out where the field is going, particularly if you do not work in this field. Unfortunately, this is the case for people who have to make decisions about funding, grants, tenure, and other unpleasant aspects in the life of a physicist. They have a hard time figuring out where to put this subject which is neither applied science nor dealing with the smallest length scales or the highest energies. However, the richness of the field comes precisely from its diversity.

The past few decades have witnessed the development of two areas of condensed matter physics that best illustrate the strengths of this field: critical phenomena and the quantum Hall effect. In both cases, it was the ability to produce extremely pure samples which allowed the discovery and experimental study of the phenomenon. Their physical explanation required the use of new concepts and the development of new theoretical tools, such as the renormalization group, conformal invariance, and fractional statistics.

While the concept of conformal invariance was well known in field theory before critical phenomena became recognized as a field, its importance to the complete structure of the field theory was not understood. The situation changed with the development of the renormalization group (RG). For condensed matter physics, the RG is the main tool for the interpretation of the experimental data, providing the conceptual framework and the computational algorithm which has allowed the theory to make powerful predictions. In particle physics, the RG is also a tool for the interpretation of the data. But, more importantly, the concept of an infraredunstable fixed point has become the definition of the field theory itself.

Similarly, the Chern-Simons theories, which are field theories that describe systems exhibiting fractional statistics, were known before the quantum Hall effect (QHE) was discovered (actually they were discovered at about the same time), but were regarded as a curiosity of field theories below four dimensions: in other words, a beautiful piece of mathematical physics but without relevance to "the world." We have come to recognize that Chern-Simons theories are the natural theoretical framework to describe the quantum Hall effect.

Another case relevant to this point is superconductivity. Viable mechanisms for superconductivity have been known for the fifty-some years that have passed since the theory of Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS). This theory has successfully explained superconductivity, and a variety of related phenomena, in very diverse areas of physics. This theory has been applied to diverse areas of physics, ranging from superconductivity in metals and superfluidity of liquid ${ }^{3} \mathrm{He}$ in condensed matter physics to neutron stars and nuclear matter in nuclear physics, and dynamical symmetry breaking and grand unification mechanisms (such as technicolor) in elementary-particle physics.

The origin of this constant interplay between field theory and condensed matter (or statistical) physics is that, despite their superficial differences, both fields deal with problems that involve a large (macroscopic) number of degrees of freedom that interact with each other. Thus, it should be no surprise that the same techniques can be used in both fields. The traditional trend was that field theory provided the tools (and the "sexy" terms) which were later adapted to a condensed matter problem. In turn, condensed matter models were used as "toy models" in which to try new techniques. Although this is still the case, more recent developments in condensed matter physics have allowed us to investigate new fundamental conceptual problems in quantum field theory. However, as the examples of the RG and the QHE show, the "toy models" can provide a framework for the understanding of much more general phenomenon. The experimental accessibility of condensed matter systems is just as important. The MOSFETs and heterostructures in which the QHE is studied have given us the surprisingly exact quantization of the Hall conductance whose understanding has required the use of topology and fiber bundles.

The importance of condensed matter physics to field theory, and vice versa, has been recognized at least since the 1950s. Landau and Feynman are perhaps the two theorists who best understood this deep connection. They worked in both fields and used their ideas and experience from one field in the other and then the converse.

### 1.2 What has been included in this book (first edition)

This volume is an outgrowth of the course "Physics of Strongly Correlated Systems" which I taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the

Fall of 1989. Much of the material covered here has been the subject of intense research by a lot of people during the past four years. Most of what I discuss here has never been presented in a book, with the possible exception of some reprint volumes. While the choice of the material is motivated by current work on high-temperature superconductors, the methods and ideas have a wide range of applicability.

This book is not a textbook. Many of the problems, ideas, and methods which are discussed here have become essential to our current understanding of condensed matter physics. I have made a considerable effort to make the material largely self-contained. Many powerful methods, which are necessary for the study of condensed matter systems in the strong-fluctuation limit, are discussed and explained in some detail within the context of the applications. Thus, although the theoretical apparatus is not developed systematically and in its full glory, this material may be useful to many graduate students, in order for them to learn both the subject and the methods. For the most part I have refrained from just quoting results without explaining where they come from. So, if a particular method happens to be appropriate to the study of a particular subject, I present a more or less detailed description of the method itself. Thus, various essential theoretical tools are discussed and explained. Unfortunately, I was able to cover only part of the material I wanted to include. Perhaps the biggest omission is a description of conformal field theory. This will have to wait for a second edition, if and when I ever become crazy enough to come back to this nightmare.

The material discussed here includes path-integral methods applied to several problems in condensed matter such as the Hubbard model, quantum spin systems and the fractional quantum Hall effect; $1 / N, 1 / S$, and other semi-classical expansions; coherent states; the Bethe ansatz; Jordan-Wigner transformations and bosonization; gauge invariance; topological invariants in antiferromagnets; the Hall effect; and the Chern-Simons theory of fractional statistics. The material is always developed within the context of a particular application. While there is the danger that the application may go "out of fashion," I find that it is easier to motivate and to understand this material within the framework of a concrete problem. Perhaps what this book may be good for is not so much for learning the techniques but as a place to find the conceptual framework of field theory in a condensed matter setting.

### 1.3 What was left out of the first edition

The course that I taught had as its subtitle "High Temperature Superconductors and Quantum Antiferromagnets." As the reader will soon find out, in the material that I have covered there is plenty of quantum antiferromagnetism but little superconductivity. This is not an oversight on my part. Rather, it is a reflection of what we understand today on this subject which is still a wide open field. Thus I chose not
to include the very latest fashion on the subject but only what appears to be rather well established. This is a field that has produced a large number of very exciting ideas. However, the gedanken theories still dominate. To an extent, this book reflects my own efforts in transforming several fascinating gedanken theories into something more or less concrete.

Still, the tantalizing properties of the high-temperature superconductors seem to demand from us novel mechanisms such as Phil Anderson's RVB. But, of course, this is far from being universally accepted. After all, with a theory like BCS being around, with so many successes in its bag, it seems strange that anybody would look for any other mechanism to explain the superconductivity of a set of rather complex materials. After all, who would believe that understanding the superconductivity produced by stuff made with copper and oxygen, mixed and cooked just right, would require the development of fundamentally new ideas? Right? Well, maybe yes, maybe not.

### 1.4 What has been included in the second edition

I have not changed at all the content of what I wrote in the first section of this chapter back in 1991. If anything, these words are even more pertinent today.

Over the years I have often decided that it had been a mistake to include certain topics in the first edition, since they no longer seemed relevant, and regretted not having included others for similar reasons. However, there is a conservation law of good ideas in physics. So it is often the case that a theory that was proposed at a certain time in a certain setting acquires new life and meaning in a different setting. A case in point is the material on spin liquids, both chiral and non-chiral, which was discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 of the first edition. Shortly after the book appeared it became clear that the chiral spin liquid, and the anyon superconductor, do not play a role in the physics of high-temperature superconductors. This was possible since these are examples of internally consistent theories, as opposed to gedanken ones, which make clear predictions and hence can be tested in experiment. Nevertheless, the chapters on spin liquids and quantum dimers regained their relevance in the late 1990s and in much of the following decade as evidence for the internal consistency of topological phases in frustrated quantum magnets and quantum dimer models became more established, even though so far they have eluded experimental confirmation.

This second edition is in many ways a new book. Here is a summary of what has been included. Except for correcting a few misprints and typos, Chapter 2, The Hubbard model, is the same as in the first edition. Chapter 3, The magnetic instability of the Fermi system, has been edited to remove typos and misprints and the last section has had its mistakes purged. Chapter 4, The renormalization group, is
new. In the first edition the discussion on the renormalization group was scattered throughout the text. In Chapter 4 I present a succinct but modern presentation of the subject, which sets the stage for its use in other chapters. This chapter was strongly influenced by John Cardy's beautiful textbook (Cardy, 1996). Chapter 5, Onedimensional quantum antiferromagnets, was edited and revamped. It now has three sections discussing the important subject of duality in spin systems, and another one on the one-dimensional quantum Ising model, including the exact solution. The section on Abelian bosonization was updated, particularly the notation. Chapter 6, The Luttinger liquid, is entirely new. Although some of this material also appears in Chapter 5, here I give what I think is a thorough presentation of this important problem in condensed matter. Some of the material used here is strongly inspired by reviews written by Kivelson and Emery on this problem (Emery, 1979; Carlson et al., 2004). Chapter 7, Sigma models and topological terms, is a vastly revised version of what was Chapter 5 in the first edition. The main changes in this chapter are the new sections on the Wess-Zumino-Witten model and non-abelian bosonization, and another section giving a brief presentation of the main ideas of conformal field theory (a subject that has acquired widespread use in many areas of condensed matter) and their application to the Wess-Zumino-Witten model and to quantum spin chains. For the sake of brevity I chose not to include a discussion of the Kondo problem here.

In the first edition Chapters 6 and 7 dealt with spin liquids and chiral spin states, respectively. These two chapters have been completely revised, expanded and split into three chapters, Chapters 8, 9, and 10. Chapter 8, Spin-liquid states, contains much of the discussion of the old Chapter 6 on spin liquids, valence-bond states, and the gauge-theory description of antiferromagnets, but significantly edited and updated to account for the many developments. The content of the new Chapter 9, Gauge theory, dimer models, and topological phases, is completely new. Here I include an in-depth discussion of the phases and observables of gauge theories, paying special attention to their relation to time-reversal-invariant topological phases, the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid, the Kitaev toric code, and quantum loop models. I also include a theory of quantum criticality in quantum dimer models and the quantum Lifshitz model.

In the new Chapter 10, Chiral spin states and anyons, I have merged all the discussions on the chiral spin liquid. I also expand the treatment of the Chern-Simons gauge theory and its role as a theory of fractional statistics. I also corrected some errors on the lattice version of Chern-Simons that were present in the first edition. Chapter 11, Anyon superconductivity, is a compressed version of Chapter 8 of the first edition. It is now clear that an anyon superconductor, a state resulting from the condensation of electrically charged anyons (abelian) is not essentially different from a superconductor with a spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, e.g. a
$\mathrm{p}_{x}+i \mathrm{p}_{y}$ or $\mathrm{d}_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+i \mathrm{~d}_{x y}$ superconductor. Nevertheless, I am not fond of rewriting history and for this reason I kept this chapter, after excising some results that were wrong.

Chapter 12, Topology and the quantum Hall effect, is almost the same as Chapter 9 of the first edition. I only made minor editing changes. Similarly, the new Chapter 13, The fractional quantum Hall effect, is almost the same as Chapter 10 in the first edition. The only important change here, aside from editing, was that the section on edge states is no longer in this chapter. The bulk of this chapter is devoted to a presentation of the bosonic and fermionic Chern-Simons theory of the fractional quantum Hall states.

The remaining four chapters of the new edition are new and are devoted to, respectively, Topological fluids (Chapter 14), Physics at the edge (Chapter 15), Topological insulators (Chapter 16), and Quantum entanglement (Chapter 17). Chapter 14 is devoted to the theory of topological fluids presented here as a theory of fractional quantum Hall fluids. Here I include a description of the hydrodynamic theory (of Wen and Zee), its extensions to general abelian multi-component fluids, non-abelian quantum Hall fluids, superconductors as topological fluids, and topological superconductors, and a brief presentation of the concepts of braiding and fusion. Chapter 15, Physics at the edge, is an in-depth presentation of the theory of edge states in integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids, both abelian and non-abelian, Wen's theory of bulk-edge correspondence, and the effective field theories of the non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states. I devote special sections to discussions of tunneling conductance at quantum point contacts, noise and the measurement of fractional charge, and the theory of abelian and non-abelian quantum interferometers, and there is a brief sales pitch for topological quantum computing. Chapter 16 is devoted to a brief presentation of the exciting new field of topological insulators. Here I discuss the basic concepts, band topological invariants, the anomalous quantum Hall effect, and the spin quantum Hall effect and its experimental discovery. I also discuss the extensions of these ideas to three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulators, their relations to fractional charge (and polyacetylene) in one dimension, the Callan-Harvey effect in three dimensions, surface Weyl fermions, Majorana modes, and possible new topological insulators resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Chapter 17 is devoted to the role of quantum entanglement in field theory, quantum critical systems and topological phases, and large-scale entanglement and the scaling of the entanglement entropy, as well as the relation of this problem to the modern ideas of holography and the CFT/gravity duality.

Several important subjects are not in this book. In particular, except for some cursory discussion in Chapter 2, Fermi liquids are not discussed. For this reason I have also not discussed the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity
and other mechanisms. I have also not discussed what happens when a Fermi liquid fails. This is an area to which I have devoted a great deal of effort, including the formulation of a new class of electronic liquid-crystal phases of strongly correlated systems. Experimentally these phases arise often in conjunction or in competition with high-temperature superconductivity. I have also not discussed the important problem of fermionic quantum criticality and non-Fermi-liquid behavior, with many interesting connections with the concept of holography, as well as extensions of bosonization to dimensionalities higher than two, which is a natural framework to describe these open problems. Absent from this book is also the discussion of disordered systems, a fascinating problem in which there are very few well-established results.

Finally, all the figures in this book are new because I had lost the source files of the figures that were used in the first edition. This new edition includes an extensive set of references at the end of the book, and a detailed index, which I hope will be useful to the reader.

## The Hubbard model

### 2.1 Introduction

All theories of strongly correlated electron systems begin with the Hubbard model because of its simplicity. This is a model in which band electrons interact via a two-body repulsive Coulomb interaction. No phonons are present, and in general no explicitly attractive interactions are included. For this reason, the Hubbard model has traditionally been associated with magnetism. Superconductivity, on the other hand, has traditionally (i.e. after BCS) been interpreted as an instability of the ground state resulting from effectively attractive interactions (say, electron-phonon as in BCS). A novel situation has arisen with Anderson's suggestion (Anderson, 1987) that the superconductivity of the new high- $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ materials may arise from purely repulsive interactions. This suggestion was motivated by the fact that the superconductivity seems to originate from doping (i.e. extracting or adding charges) an otherwise insulating state.

The Hubbard model is a very simple model in which one imagines that, out of the many different bands which may exist in a solid, only very few states per unit cell contribute significantly to the ground-state properties. Thus, if a Bloch state of energy $\epsilon_{p}$, momentum $\vec{p}$, and index $\alpha$ has a wavefunction $\Psi_{\vec{p}, \alpha}$, one can construct Wannier states

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Psi_{\alpha}\left(\vec{r}_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vec{p} \in \mathrm{BZ}} e^{i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{r}_{i}} \Psi_{\vec{p}, \alpha}\left(\vec{r}_{i}\right) \tag{2.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{r}_{i}$ is the location of the $i$ th atom and BZ is the Brillouin zone. The assumption here will be that only one (or a few) band indices matter, so I will drop the index $\alpha$. The Coulomb interaction matrix elements are

$$
\begin{equation*}
U_{i j, i^{\prime} j^{\prime}}=\int d^{3} r_{1} d^{3} r_{2} \Psi_{i}^{*}\left(\vec{r}_{1}\right) \Psi_{j}^{*}\left(\vec{r}_{2}\right) \tilde{V}\left(\vec{r}_{1}-\vec{r}_{2}\right) \Psi_{i^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}_{1}\right) \Psi_{j^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}_{2}\right) \tag{2.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

(in three dimensions), where $\tilde{V}$ is the (screened) Coulomb interaction. Since $\tilde{V}$ is expected to decay as the separation increases, the largest term will be the "on-site" term: $U_{i i, i i} \equiv U$. Next will come nearest neighbors, etc. Moreover, since the Wannier functions have exponentially decreasing overlaps, $U_{i j, i^{\prime} j^{\prime}}$ is expected to decrease rather rapidly with the separation $|i-j|$.

The second quantized Hamiltonian tight binding (in the Wannier-functions basis) is

$$
\begin{align*}
H= & -\sum_{\substack{\vec{r}_{i}, \vec{r}_{j} \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}_{i}\right) t_{i j} c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}_{j}\right)+c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}_{j}\right) t_{i j} c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}_{i}\right)\right) \\
& +\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\substack{i, j, i^{\prime}, j^{\prime} \\
\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}=\uparrow, \downarrow}} U_{i j, i^{\prime} j^{\prime}} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}_{i}\right) c_{\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}_{j}\right) c_{\sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}_{j^{\prime}}\right) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}_{i^{\prime}}\right) \tag{2.3}
\end{align*}
$$

where $c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r})$ creates an electron at site $\vec{r}$ with spin $\sigma$ (or more precisely, at the unit cell $\vec{r}$ in the band responsible for the Fermi surface) and satisfies

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left\{c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}), c_{\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)\right\}=\delta_{\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}} \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}}  \tag{2.4}\\
& \left\{c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}), c_{\sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)\right\}=0
\end{align*}
$$

The Hubbard model is an approximation to the more general Hamiltonian, Eq. (2.3), in which the hopping is restricted to nearest neighboring sites:

$$
t_{i j}= \begin{cases}t & \text { if } i, j \text { are nearest neighbors }  \tag{2.5}\\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

and the Coulomb interaction is assumed to be screened. If just the "on-site" term is kept,

$$
\begin{equation*}
U_{i j, i^{\prime} j^{\prime}}=U \delta_{i j} \delta_{i^{\prime} j^{\prime}} \delta_{i i^{\prime}} \tag{2.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

the resulting model Hamiltonian

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\ \sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right)+U \sum_{\vec{r}} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

is known as the one-band Hubbard model. In Eq. (2.7), we have dropped the lattice site labels and $\langle$,$\rangle means nearest-neighboring sites. This is the tight-binding$ approximation and represents the one-band Hubbard model. We have introduced

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{\sigma}(\vec{r})=c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

From the Pauli principle we get $n_{\sigma}=0,1$ or $n_{\sigma}^{2}=n_{\sigma}$ at every site.
The Hilbert space of this system is the tensor product of only four states per site, representing $|0\rangle$ as nothing, $|\uparrow\rangle$ as an electron with spin up, $|\downarrow\rangle$ as an electron with
spin down, and $|\uparrow \downarrow\rangle$ as an up-down pair. The states $|0\rangle$ and $|\uparrow \downarrow\rangle$ are spin singlets (i.e. $S=0$ ).

It is convenient to define the following operators. The spin operator $\vec{S}(\vec{r})$ is defined by (the summation convention is assumed)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}(\vec{r})=\frac{\hbar}{2} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \vec{\tau}_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} c_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{\tau}$ are the (three) Pauli matrices

$$
\tau_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 1  \tag{2.10}\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right), \quad \tau_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{array}\right), \quad \tau_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{array}\right)
$$

The particle number operator at site $\vec{r}$ (or charge) is

$$
\begin{equation*}
n(\vec{r})=\sum_{\sigma} n_{\sigma}(\vec{r})=\sum_{\sigma} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \equiv c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) 1_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} c_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the associated total charge $Q$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q=e \sum_{\vec{r}} n(\vec{r}) \equiv e N_{\mathrm{e}} \tag{2.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 2.2 Symmetries of the Hubbard model

### 2.2.1 $S U(2)$ spin

Suppose we rotate the local spin basis (i.e. the quantization axis)

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\sigma}^{\prime}(\vec{r})=U_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} c_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $U$ is a $2 \times 2 \mathrm{SU}(2)$ matrix. Namely, given four complex numbers $a, b, c$, and $d$, the matrix $U$ given by

$$
U=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c  \tag{2.14}\\
d & b
\end{array}\right)
$$

must satisfy

$$
\begin{equation*}
U^{-1}=U^{\dagger} \equiv\left(U^{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{*} \tag{2.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

together with the condition

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{det} U=1 \tag{2.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

We will parametrize the matrix $U(\vec{\theta})$ as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
U(\vec{\theta})=e^{i \vec{\theta} \cdot \vec{\tau}}=\mathbf{1} \cos |\vec{\theta}|+i \sin |\vec{\theta}| \frac{\vec{\theta} \cdot \vec{\tau}}{|\vec{\theta}|} \tag{2.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

where 1 represents the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix, $\vec{\tau}$ are the Pauli matrices, and the Euler angles $\vec{\theta}=\left(\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \theta_{3}\right)$ parametrize the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ group.

Under such a unitary transformation, the spin $\vec{S}$ transforms as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
S^{\prime a}(\vec{r}) & =R^{a b} S^{b}(\vec{r}) \\
& =\frac{\hbar}{2} c^{\prime \dagger}(\vec{r}) \tau^{a} c^{\prime}(\vec{r}) \\
& =\frac{\hbar}{2} c^{\dagger}(\vec{r})\left(U^{-1} \tau^{a} U\right) c(\vec{r}) \tag{2.18}
\end{align*}
$$

where $R^{a b}$ is a rotation matrix induced by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ transformation of the fermions:

$$
\begin{equation*}
U^{-1} \tau^{a} U=R^{a b} \tau^{b} \tag{2.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

In other words, we have a rotation of the quantization axis.
The axis of quantization can be chosen arbitrarily. Thus, the Hubbard model Hamiltonian should not change its form under a rotation of the spin quantization axis. This is not apparent in the standard form of the interaction

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{1}=U \sum_{\vec{r}} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

But we can write this in a somewhat different form in which the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry becomes explicit. Consider the operator

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2}=\sum_{\substack{\vec{r} \\ a=1,2,3}} S^{a}(\vec{r}) S^{a}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

By expanding the components and making use of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ identity

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{a=1,2,3} \tau_{\alpha \beta}^{a} \tau_{\gamma \delta}^{a}=2 \delta_{\alpha \delta} \delta_{\beta \gamma}-\delta_{\alpha \beta} \delta_{\gamma \delta} \tag{2.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

one gets

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2}=\sum_{\vec{r}}\left(\frac{3}{4} n(\vec{r})-\frac{3}{2} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r})\right) \tag{2.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{1}=U \sum_{\vec{r}} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r})=-\frac{2 U}{3} \vec{S}^{2}(\vec{r})+\frac{N_{\mathrm{e}} U}{2} \tag{2.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

The last term is a constant, which can be dropped. The Hamiltonian now has the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\ \sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right)-\frac{2 U}{3} \sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2}+\frac{N_{\mathrm{e}} U}{2} \tag{2.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is manifestly $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-invariant.
For $U>0$, the interaction energy is lowered if the total spin at each site is maximized. Thus, one should expect some sort of magnetic ground state, at least if each site has one particle (on average). This state requires that the system somehow should pick a global (i.e. the same for all sites) quantization axis. In other words, the global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin symmetry may be spontaneously broken. This has important consequences, which we will discuss later.

### 2.2.2 U(1) charge

We are free to change the phase of the one-particle wavefunction

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\sigma}^{\prime}(\vec{r})=e^{i \theta} c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here, $e^{i \theta}$ is an element of the group $\mathrm{U}(1)$, and group elements satisfy

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{i \theta} e^{i \theta^{\prime}}=e^{i\left(\theta+\theta^{\prime}\right)} \tag{2.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

The Hamiltonian is invariant under this $\mathrm{U}(1)$ transformation. This is nothing but charge conservation. For example, if we had terms that would not conserve charge, like

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \rightarrow e^{i 2 \theta} c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

we would not have this invariance.
Suppose now that we couple this system to the electromagnetic field $\left(A_{0}, \vec{A}\right)$. We expect three effects.

1. A Zeeman coupling given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\text {Zeeman }}=g \sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{S}(\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

which couples the spin $\vec{S}(\vec{r})$ with the local magnetic field $\vec{B}(\vec{r})$ so as to align it along the $\vec{B}(\vec{r})$ direction.
2. An orbital coupling for electrons in a crystal with one-particle Hamiltonian

$$
\begin{equation*}
H(\vec{p})=\frac{1}{2 m_{\mathrm{e}}}\left(\vec{p}-\frac{e}{c} \vec{A}\right)^{2}+V(\vec{r}) \tag{2.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $V(\vec{r})$ is the periodic potential imposed by the crystal. In the tight-binding approximation, we must therefore modify the kinetic-energy term according to

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{0} \equiv & -t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right) \\
& \rightarrow-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) e^{\frac{i e}{\hbar c} \int_{\vec{r}}^{\vec{r}^{\prime}} d \vec{x} \cdot \vec{A}(\vec{x})} c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) e^{-\frac{i e}{\hbar c} \int_{\vec{r}}^{\vec{r}^{\prime}} d \vec{x} \cdot \vec{A}(\vec{x})} c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right) \tag{2.31}
\end{align*}
$$

We should now check the gauge invariance under the transformation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{A}^{\prime}=\vec{A}+\vec{\nabla} \Lambda \tag{2.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Lambda$ is an arbitrary function of space and time. We get the change

$$
\begin{align*}
A^{\prime}\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right) & \equiv \int_{\vec{r}}^{\vec{r}^{\prime}} d \vec{x} \cdot \vec{A}^{\prime}(\vec{x}) \\
& =A\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\Lambda\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)-\Lambda(\vec{r}) \tag{2.33}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus the kinetic-energy term is gauge-invariant,

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{0}^{\prime} & \equiv-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\prime \dagger}(\vec{r}) e^{\frac{i e}{\hbar c} A^{\prime}\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right)} c_{\sigma}^{\prime}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right) \\
& =-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) e^{-i \theta(\vec{r})} e^{\frac{i e}{\hbar c}\left(A\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\Lambda\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)-\Lambda(\vec{r})\right)} e^{+i \theta\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)} c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right) \tag{2.34}
\end{align*}
$$

provided that the local change of phase is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta(\vec{r}) \equiv-\frac{e}{\hbar c} \Lambda(\vec{r}) \tag{2.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

3. An electrostatic coupling given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\text {electrostatic }}=\sum_{\vec{r}, \sigma} e A_{0}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \tag{2.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

which couples the particle density to $A_{0}(\vec{r})$.

### 2.2.3 Particle-hole transformations

In the case of a bipartite lattice (i.e. a lattice that is the union of two interpenetrating sublattices $A$ and $B$ ) we get additional symmetries.

1. First, the sign of $t$ can be changed. Consider the transformation

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \rightarrow+c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) & \text { if } & \vec{r} \in A \\
c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \rightarrow-c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) & \text { if } & \vec{r} \in B \tag{2.37}
\end{array}
$$

under which the kinetic energy changes sign:

$$
\begin{equation*}
t c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \rightarrow-t c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right), \quad \vec{r} \in A, \quad \vec{r}^{\prime} \in B \tag{2.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

while the potential energy is left unchanged. This transformation leaves the canonical commutation relations unchanged and therefore leaves the spectrum unchanged.
2. Now consider the particle-hole transformation

$$
\begin{align*}
& c_{\uparrow}(\vec{r})=d_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) \\
& c_{\downarrow}(\vec{r})= \begin{cases}+d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}), & \vec{r} \in A \\
-d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}), & \vec{r} \in B\end{cases} \tag{2.39}
\end{align*}
$$

The Hamiltonian $H(t, U)$, Eq. (2.7), changes into $H(t,-U)+U N_{\uparrow}$, where $N_{\uparrow}$ is the total number of up spins (which is conserved), since under this transformation we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{\uparrow}+n_{\downarrow}=c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{\uparrow}+c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{\downarrow}=d_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} d_{\uparrow}+d_{\downarrow} d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}=d_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} d_{\uparrow}-d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger} d_{\downarrow}+1 \tag{2.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{\uparrow}-n_{\downarrow}=c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{\uparrow}-c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{\downarrow}=d_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} d_{\uparrow}-d_{\downarrow} d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}=d_{\uparrow}^{\dagger} d_{\uparrow}+d_{\downarrow}^{\dagger} d_{\downarrow}-1 \tag{2.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similarly, the charge $Q$ and the component $S_{z}$ of the total spin transform as

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q \rightarrow S_{z}+1, \quad S_{z} \rightarrow Q-1 \tag{2.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the attractive and the repulsive cases map into each other and, at the same time, spin maps into charge and vice versa. Note that for negative $U<0$ the Hamiltonian favors local spin-singlet states $(S=0)$, i.e. empty and doubly occupied sites.

### 2.3 The strong-coupling limit

We consider now the strong-coupling limit of the Hubbard model, i.e. $U \rightarrow \infty$. The half-filled case is special but important. We will consider it first.

### 2.3.1 The half-filled system $(U>0)$

Recall that the interaction term

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{int}} \equiv-\frac{2}{3} U \sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2} \tag{2.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

forces the spin $\vec{S}$ to be largest if $U$ becomes infinitely large, i.e. doubly occupied sites are forbidden. Only $|\uparrow\rangle$ and $|\downarrow\rangle$ states are kept in this large- $U$ limit at

Figure 2.1 Configurations (a) and (c) are two configurations of spins corresponding to orthogonal ground states of $H_{0}$. They differ by the exchange of two neighboring spins. Configuration (b) corresponds to a virtual state. The circles represent the unit cells of the crystal and the arrows are the components of the spin along the quantization axis.
half-filling. The interaction part of the Hamiltonian has infinitely many eigenstates. Any spin configuration is an eigenstate. In order to lift this massive degeneracy we will keep the effects of fluctuations induced by the kinetic-energy term to leading order in an expansion in $t / U$. We have to solve a problem in degenerate perturbation theory, a strong-coupling expansion.

Suppose we begin with any configuration that can be labeled by the local $z$-component of the spin $|\{\sigma(\vec{r})\}\rangle$ (see Fig. 2.1(a)). In an expansion in powers of $t / U$, we have intermediate states in which one site will become doubly occupied and, at the same time, another site becomes empty (see Fig. 2.1(b)). This state has an energy $U$ above that of the degenerate ground states. The matrix element (squared) is $t^{2}$. There is also a multiplicity factor of 2 since this process can occur in two different ways. Hence we expect that the relevant parameter of the effective Hamiltonian should be $2 t^{2} / U$. Also, the final state has to be either the same one as the initial state or it can differ at most by a spin exchange (see Fig. 2.1(c)). The natural candidate for the effective Hamiltonian is the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

We can obtain this result by carrying out this expansion explicitly (Emery, 1979). Let $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$ denote the kinetic and interaction terms of the Hubbard Hamiltonian $H$, Eq. (2.7),

$$
\begin{align*}
& H_{0}=-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right)  \tag{2.44}\\
& H_{1}=U \sum_{\vec{r}} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r})
\end{align*}
$$

Let $|\alpha\rangle$ be any of the $2^{N}$ states with every site occupied by a spin either up or down. Here, $|\alpha\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_{1}$ with eigenvalue $E_{1}=0$.

We will use Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory (Baym, 1974) Consider Schrödinger's equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
H|\Psi\rangle=E|\Psi\rangle \tag{2.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $|\Psi\rangle$ is any eigenstate. We can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(E-H_{1}\right)|\Psi\rangle=H_{0}|\Psi\rangle \tag{2.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

Formally, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
|\Psi\rangle & =\frac{1}{E-H_{1}} H_{0}|\Psi\rangle \\
& =\frac{\hat{P}}{E-H_{1}} H_{0}|\Psi\rangle+\sum_{\alpha}|\alpha\rangle \frac{\langle\alpha| H_{0}|\Psi\rangle}{E-E_{1}} \tag{2.47}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{1}|\alpha\rangle=E_{1}|\alpha\rangle \tag{2.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{P}=1-\sum_{\alpha}|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| \tag{2.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

projects out of the unperturbed states. Clearly $\hat{P}$ commutes with $H_{1}$. Define $\left|\Psi_{\alpha}\right\rangle$ as the solution of the equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\Psi_{\alpha}\right\rangle=|\alpha\rangle+\frac{\hat{P}}{E-H_{1}} H_{0}\left|\Psi_{\alpha}\right\rangle \tag{2.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

Let $a_{\alpha}$ be given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{\alpha}=\frac{\langle\alpha| H_{0}|\Psi\rangle}{E-E_{1}} \tag{2.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{\alpha} a_{\alpha}\left|\Psi_{\alpha}\right\rangle \tag{2.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we iterate Eq. (2.50) to first order in powers of $\left[\hat{P} /\left(E-H_{1}\right)\right] H_{0}$, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\Psi_{\alpha}\right\rangle \approx|\alpha\rangle+\frac{\hat{P}}{E-H_{1}} H_{0}|\alpha\rangle \approx|\alpha\rangle-\frac{1}{U} H_{0}|\alpha\rangle \tag{2.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

since $\langle\beta| H_{0}|\alpha\rangle=0$ at half-filling. Thus, if we insert Eq. (2.53) into Eq. (2.52), and in turn insert this into Eq. (2.51), we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(E-E_{1}\right) a_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{\alpha^{\prime}}\langle\alpha| H_{0}^{2}\left|\alpha^{\prime}\right\rangle a_{\alpha^{\prime}} \tag{2.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is the same as the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian $H_{0}^{\prime}=H_{0}^{2} /|U|$, where $H_{0}^{\prime}$, at half-filling, is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{0}^{\prime}=\frac{2 t^{2}}{|U|} \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} \vec{S}(\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{S}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

In other words, we find the spin one-half quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet with the exchange coupling $J=2 t^{2} /|U|$. This result is valid for the half-filled system in any dimension and for any lattice.

### 2.3.2 Away from half-filling

Clearly other processes are now allowed. If $U \gg t$, doubly occupied sites are energetically very expensive. Thus the restricted Hilbert space now consists of configurations made of empty sites (holes), and up and down spins.

The kinetic-energy term will allow charge motion since empty sites (holes) will be able to move. These holes carry electric charge but have no spin. The effective Hamiltonian now has the form of the $t-J$ model:

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=-t \sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\ \sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right)+J \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} \vec{S}(\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{S}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

(where $J=2 t^{2} /|U|$ ), with the constraint

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})=n(\vec{r})=0,1 \tag{2.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

which eliminates doubly occupied sites. Now we have two separately conserved quantities: the charge $Q$, which equals the number of holes, and the spin component $S_{z}=\sum_{\vec{r}} S_{z}(\vec{r})$. It is clear that as the holes move they can induce spin-flip processes. The spin configurations get disrupted by the motion of holes and the long-range order (antiferromagnetic) may be destroyed. Presumably it should take a finite density of holes to destroy the long-range order. We will discuss this strong-coupling limit at great length. Let us first consider the opposite case.

### 2.4 The weak-coupling limit

In the weak-coupling limit $U \ll t$ we may think of the interaction as a weak perturbation. One therefore expects that the states of a weakly coupled electron gas may be qualitatively similar to the states of a free-electron gas. This picture is usually called a Fermi liquid (Pines and Nozières, 1966). The main assumption is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the states of a free-fermion system and those in a weakly interacting one.

For free fermions, the Hamiltonian reduces to the kinetic-energy term. For the Hubbard model we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{0}=-\sum_{\substack{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime} \\ \sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right) \tag{2.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

It is convenient to go to Fourier space (momentum). Assume that we are in $d$ space dimensions and that the lattice has $N^{d}$ sites with $N$ even (for simplicity). With $V \equiv N^{d}$, we define

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{V} \sum_{\vec{k}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}} c_{\sigma}(\vec{k}) \tag{2.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{k}=\frac{2 \pi}{N}\left(n_{1}, \ldots, n_{d}\right)-(\pi, \ldots, \pi) \tag{2.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $1 \leq n_{i} \leq N$. Thus the momenta $k_{i}$ vary over the range $-\pi+2 \pi / N \leq k_{i} \leq \pi$. In the thermodynamic limit $N \rightarrow \infty, 2 \pi / N \rightarrow 0$ and the $k$ s become uniformly distributed in the interval $-\pi \leq k_{i} \leq \pi$, the Brillouin zone.

Remember the following properties of Fourier transforms. Let $k=(2 \pi / N)$ $n-\pi, n=1, \ldots, N$ and let $f(k)$ be some function of $k$. We have the Riemann sums

$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k} f(k) & =\frac{1}{\Delta k} \sum_{k} \Delta k f(k)  \tag{2.61}\\
& \rightarrow \frac{N}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} d k f(k) \quad \text { as } \quad N \rightarrow \infty
\end{align*}
$$

where $\Delta k=2 \pi / N$. The extension to the $d$-dimensional case is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\vec{k}} f(\vec{k}) \rightarrow N^{d} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} f(\vec{k}) \quad \text { as } \quad N \rightarrow \infty \tag{2.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

In particular, as $N \rightarrow \infty$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{N^{d}} \sum_{\vec{k}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)} & =\delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \rightarrow \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)}=\delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \\
\sum_{\vec{r}} e^{i\left(\vec{k}-\vec{k}^{\prime}\right) \cdot \vec{r}} & =N^{d} \delta_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}^{\prime}} \rightarrow(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{(d)}\left(\vec{k}-\vec{k}^{\prime}\right) \\
c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) & \rightarrow \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}} c_{\sigma(\vec{k})} \tag{2.63}
\end{align*}
$$

The canonical (anti)commutation relations

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}), c_{\sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)\right\}=\delta_{\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}} \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \tag{2.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

become, in the same limit,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}), c_{\sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{k}^{\prime}\right)\right\}=\delta_{\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}} \delta_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}^{\prime}} \rightarrow(2 \pi)^{d} \delta_{\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}} \delta^{(d)}\left(\vec{k}-\vec{k}^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

The kinetic energy then takes the form

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{0} & =-\sum_{\substack{\overrightarrow{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right) \\
& =-\sum_{\substack{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime} \\
\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}} t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \int \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \int \frac{d^{d} k^{\prime}}{(2 \pi)^{d}}\left(e^{-i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}+i \vec{k}^{\prime} \cdot \vec{r}^{\prime}} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{k}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right) \tag{2.66}
\end{align*}
$$

If by $t(\vec{k})$ we denote the Fourier transform of $t(\vec{l})$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
t(\vec{k})=\sum_{\vec{l}} t(\vec{l}) e^{-i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{l}} \tag{2.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) e^{-i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}+i \vec{k}^{\prime} \cdot \vec{r}^{\prime}}=t(\vec{k})(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{(d)}\left(\vec{k}-\vec{k}^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the case

$$
t\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \equiv t(\vec{l})= \begin{cases}t & \text { for nearest neighbors }  \tag{2.69}\\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
t(\vec{k})=2 t \sum_{j=1}^{d} \cos k_{j} \tag{2.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

and a free Hamiltonian of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{0}=\sum_{\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow} \int \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \epsilon(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{k}) \tag{2.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon(\vec{k})=-t(\vec{k})=-2 t \sum_{j=1}^{d} \cos k_{j} \tag{2.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

The ground state is found by filling up the Fermi sea. Thus, if we have $N$ particles, the total number of momentum states with energy smaller than $E$ is (assuming that $\epsilon_{\vec{k}}$ has its minimum at $\left.\vec{k}=(0 \ldots 0)\right)$ determined by the constant-energy curves
$\epsilon(\vec{k}) \equiv \epsilon$ (see Fig. 2.2). For instance, in the one-dimensional case we find (see Fig. 2.3)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon(k)=-2 t \cos k \tag{2.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\mathcal{N}$ is the number of particles and $N$ the number of sites, we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{N}=2 N \int_{-k_{\mathrm{F}}}^{k_{\mathrm{F}}} \frac{d k}{2 \pi}=\frac{2 N k_{\mathrm{F}}}{\pi} \tag{2.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{\pi \mathcal{N}}{2 N} \equiv \frac{\pi}{2} \rho \tag{2.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\rho$ is the linear density. At half-filling $k_{\mathrm{F}}=\pi / 2$ and $\epsilon\left(k_{\mathrm{F}}\right)$ vanishes. In higher dimensions we determine the constant-energy curves in the same way. For a halffilled system we just fill up the negative-energy states to obtain the Fermi sea. This is so because this band has $E \leftrightarrow-E$ symmetry ("particle-hole" symmetry) and there are as many states with positive energy as there are with negative energy. The Fermi surface is defined by $\epsilon_{\mathrm{F}}=0$ and for a square lattice is rectangular (square) (see Fig. 2.4).

The expectation value of the occupation number

$$
\begin{equation*}
n_{\vec{k}}=\sum_{\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{k}) \tag{2.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

has a jump at the Fermi surface both in the free case and in the case with interaction (see Fig. 2.5).

### 2.5 Correlation functions

The fermion Green function (or propagator) plays an important role in the theory. We can define it in terms of field operators in the Heisenberg representation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_21_8c6677f87cb2cf5c3b27g-040.jpg?height=585&width=771&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=467)

Figure 2.5 Occupation number of the energy levels labeled by $k$ in the noninteracting case (straight line) and interacting (curved line) case; $Z$ is the quasiparticle residue of Eq. (2.84).

$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}, t)=e^{i H t} c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) e^{-i H t} \tag{2.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

The fermion propagator is defined by

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=-i\langle\operatorname{Gnd}| T c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}, t) c_{\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.78}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle$ stands for the ground state of the system and $T$ means a time-ordered product of operators,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T A(t) B\left(t^{\prime}\right)=A(t) B\left(t^{\prime}\right) \theta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \pm B\left(t^{\prime}\right) A(t) \theta\left(t^{\prime}-t\right) \tag{2.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $\mathrm{a}+(-)$ sign for bosons (fermions) and

$$
\theta(t)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } t>0  \tag{2.80}\\ 0 & \text { if } t<0\end{cases}
$$

For a translationally invariant and time-independent system, we can write $G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)$ in terms of its Fourier transform (Abrikosov et al., 1963; Fetter and Walecka, 1971; Doniach and Sondheimer, 1974)

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\int \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} \int \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} e^{i\left(\vec{k} \cdot\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)-\omega\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right)} G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, \omega) \tag{2.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

In principle $G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ is a $2 \times 2$ spin matrix. In the case of a non-interacting system (and for any spin-isotropic ground state, for that matter), $G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}^{(0)}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ is very simple to compute (Fetter and Walecka, 1971). The result is

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, \omega)=\delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} \lim _{v \rightarrow 0^{+}}\left(\frac{\theta\left(\epsilon(\vec{k})-\epsilon_{\mathrm{F}}\right)}{\omega-\epsilon(\vec{k})+i v}+\frac{\theta\left(\epsilon_{\mathrm{F}}-\epsilon(\vec{k})\right)}{\omega-\epsilon(\vec{k})-i v}\right) \tag{2.82}
\end{equation*}
$$

The poles of $G_{\alpha \beta}^{0}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ exhibit the physical one-particle excitation spectrum

$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\epsilon(\vec{k}) \tag{2.83}
\end{equation*}
$$

A weakly interacting system (a Fermi liquid) resembles a non-interacting one in the sense that the physical low-energy excitations look like weakly interacting fermions. Thus the fermion propagator retains its pole structure, albeit with a renormalized dispersion relation $\omega=\epsilon_{\text {ren }}(\vec{k})$ and a non-trivial residue for energies close to the Fermi energy. In other words, for $\omega \sim \epsilon_{\mathrm{F}}$ the propagator should look like

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim _{\substack{\omega \rightarrow \epsilon_{\mathrm{F}} \\ v \rightarrow 0^{+}}} G(\vec{k}, \omega) \approx \lim _{\substack{\omega \rightarrow \epsilon_{\mathrm{F}} \\ v \rightarrow 0^{+}}}\left(\frac{Z}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathrm{ren}}(\vec{k})+i v}+G_{\mathrm{reg}}(\vec{k}, \omega)\right) \tag{2.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $Z$ is the residue and $G_{\text {reg }}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ does not have any singularities close to $\epsilon_{\mathrm{F}}$. The wave-function renormalization $Z$ measures the strength of the jump of the fermion occupation number $n_{\vec{k}}$ at the Fermi surface, see Fig. 2.5. These excitations are the fermion quasiparticles, the dressed electrons, of the Fermi liquid. These quasiparticles are assumed to be stable in the sense that the poles lie on the real energy axis. Any imaginary part would imply a decay rate of the quasiparticles ("damping"). The existence of such fermionic quasiparticles in the low-energy spectrum of a system of interacting fermions is the central content (and assumption) of the Landau theory of the Fermi liquid (Baym and Pethick, 1991).

In addition to one-particle states, a Fermi liquid has a large class of many-particle excitations. These include particle-hole excitations (i.e. density fluctuations), spin excitations, and paramagnons. These collective modes are bound states that exist only in an interacting system. Many of these modes are damped. Others are not. We can study the collective modes by means of the many-particle Green functions. Several correlation functions are going to be important to us. They are outlined below.
(1) The density correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{00}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| T \hat{n}(\vec{r}, t) \hat{n}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{n}(\vec{r}, t)$ is the local normal-ordered density operator

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{n}(\vec{r}, t)=\sum_{\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}, t) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r}, t)-\rho \tag{2.86}
\end{equation*}
$$

and $\rho$ is the average density.

The density correlation function measures the strength of the density fluctuations in a physical system. As we will see in other chapters, it plays a key role in understanding the dielectric properties of a system. If the Hamiltonian system is translationally invariant (or, equivalently, invariant under lattice translations, as the Hubbard model is) and time-independent, then the correlation function can only be a function of the separation $\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}$ and of the time difference $t-t^{\prime}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{00}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right) \equiv K_{00}\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}, t-t^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.87}
\end{equation*}
$$

whose Fourier transform has the form $K_{00}(\vec{k}, \omega)$.
In many electronic systems, such as $\mathrm{NbSe}_{2}$ (and other chalcogenides), and in strongly correlated systems, such as the high-temperature superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{2-x} \mathrm{Ba}_{x} \mathrm{CuO}_{4}$ for some doping range $x \sim 1 / 8$, the electronic ground state is a charged stripe or (charge) density wave (CDW) that breaks spontaneously the lattice translation symmetry. The $C D W$ order parameter $\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| n(\vec{Q})|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle$ is the ground-state expectation value of the Fourier transform of the density operator at the ordering wave vector $\vec{Q}$ of the CDW. In a CDW state, the Fourier transform of the density correlation function takes the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{00}(\vec{k}, \omega)=|\langle n(\vec{Q})\rangle|^{2} \delta(\vec{k}-\vec{Q}) \delta(\omega)+K_{00}^{\mathrm{conn}}(\vec{k}, \omega) \tag{2.88}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the connected correlation function $K_{00}^{\operatorname{conn}}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ contains the information on the spectrum of density fluctuations of this state. This correlator can be measured by a number of experimental techniques such as light and X-ray scattering.
(2) The current correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{i i^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| T J_{i}(\vec{r}, t) J_{i^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $J_{i}(\vec{r}, t)$ is the current operator, which, in the case of the Hubbard model in the absence of external electromagnetic fields, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{i}(\vec{r}, t)=-i t \sum_{\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow}\left(c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}, t) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}+\vec{e}_{i}, t\right)-\text { h.c. }\right) \tag{2.90}
\end{equation*}
$$

There is no need to normal-order this operator since the ground state is not expected to spontaneously carry a non-zero current. The current correlation function has the most direct information on the conductivity and can also be measured by light scattering and similar experimental techniques.
(3) The spin correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
K^{a a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\langle\operatorname{Gnd}| T S^{a}(\vec{r}, t) S^{a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

We will see below that, if the spin symmetry is broken spontaneously (i.e. magnetism), $K^{a a^{\prime}}$ can be non-zero as $(\vec{r}, t)$ and $\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)$ become infinitely separated from each other. In fact, the limit (at equal time!)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim _{\left|\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right| \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{3} \sum_{a=1}^{3} K^{a a}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t\right)=M^{2} \tag{2.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

represents the amplitude of the ferromagnetic order parameter $M$. A non-zero order parameter $M$ signals the presence of a spontaneously broken symmetry. If the magnetic ordering has a spatial dependence with an ordering wave vector $\vec{Q}$ it is a spin-density wave (SDW) whose order parameter is the Fourier transform at wave vector $\vec{Q}$ of the ground-state expectation value of the spin-density operator $\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| \vec{S}(\vec{r})|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle$, the local magnetization. In the case of antiferromagnetism, the ground state is a Néel state, in which case the ordering wave vector is $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$ (in two dimensions), and the order parameter is the staggered magnetization, which takes opposite values on the two sublattices of the square lattice.
(4) The Cooper-pair correlation function

All of these two-particle operators have the common feature that they conserve particle numbers locally and the excitations are electrically neutral. In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity particle-number conservation is lost locally (but not globally), since one could break a Cooper pair at one location and form it again somewhere else. In BCS theory (Schrieffer, 1964), a Cooper pair is a bound state of an electron with momentum $\vec{k}$ and spin up and another electron with momentum $-\vec{k}$ and spin down, with $\vec{k}$ on the Fermi surface. This state has charge $2 e$ and is a spin singlet. The order parameter for a superconducting state is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k})=\langle\operatorname{Gnd}| c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(k) c_{\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}(-\vec{k})|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

In a BCS state $\vec{k}$ and $-\vec{k}$ are two vectors on the Fermi surface and $\Delta(\vec{k})$ is the Cooper-pair amplitude. If $\Delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k})$ does not depend on the direction of $\vec{k}$, as in most low-temperature superconductors, such as niobium, the superconductor is in an s-wave state. Other superconductor order-parameter symmetries, i.e. other angular-momentum channels, are also possible. In general, the fermionic nature of the electrons dictates that states which pair in an even-angular-momentum channel (such as s-wave and d-wave states) must be spin singlets, while those which pair in an odd-angular-momentum channel (such as p-wave states) must be spin triplets. Thus, ${ }^{3} \mathrm{He} \mathrm{A}$ has an order parameter that is a spin triplet and a p-wave orbital state. The order parameter of the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors is a spin singlet and has d-wave orbital symmetry, specifically $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$, and is invariant under time-reversal invariance. However, superconducting states that break time-reversal invariance are also possible. An example of a time-reversal-invariance-breaking superconducting state is the case of the p-wave, specifically $p_{x}+i p_{y}$, spin-triplet state that appears to describe the superconductivity of the ruthenate $\mathrm{Sr}_{2} \mathrm{RuO}_{4}$. We can now define a Cooper-pair correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
C\left(\vec{k}, t ; \vec{k}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| T\left(c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}, t) c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}(-\vec{k}, t) c_{\uparrow}\left(\vec{k}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right) c_{\downarrow}\left(-\vec{k}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

From an experimental point of view, what one can measure are susceptibilities. In other words, one couples the system to a weak external field. From linear-response theory (Fetter and Walecka, 1971; Doniach and Sondheimer, 1974) we know how to relate the response functions (i.e. causal propagators) to the time-ordered functions. The susceptibilities are the Fourier-transformed causal propagators. For instance, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi^{a a^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\chi^{a a^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, \omega)=\sum_{\vec{r}} \int d t e^{i(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}-\omega t)} \chi^{a a^{\prime}}(0,0 ; \vec{r}, t) \tag{2.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\chi^{a a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)$ is the causal (or retarded) propagator

$$
\begin{equation*}
\chi^{a a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}, t ; \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)=\theta\left(t^{\prime}-t\right)\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| S^{a}(\vec{r}, t) S^{a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{2.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

In particular the static susceptibility $\chi^{a a^{\prime}}(\vec{k}, 0)$ measures the response of the system to a weak external magnetic field. In the uniform limit $\vec{k} \rightarrow 0$, we are measuring the response to a weak uniform magnetic field. Thus this is the static ferromagnetic susceptibility. If we want to probe a Néel state we must couple to the staggered magnetization and hence use a staggered field. This is difficult to achieve. However, using neutron scattering we can measure $\chi(\vec{k}, \omega)$ for a wide range of wave vectors $\vec{k}$, in particular the case $\vec{k}=(\pi, \pi, \pi)$, which is the staggered or Néel susceptibility.

## The magnetic instability of the Fermi system

The Hubbard model was originally introduced as the simplest system which may exhibit an insulating (Mott) state. This state is the result of strong electron-electron interactions. In this chapter we consider the Hubbard model at half-filling. The main goal here is the study of the magnetic properties of its ground state. Apart from an exact solution in one dimension, no exact results are available for this problem. This leads to the use of several approximations. The most popular one, and the oldest, is the mean-field theory (MFT). In the MFT one has the bias that the ground state does have some sort of magnetic order (i.e. ferromagnetic, Néel antiferromagnetic, etc.). The problem is then usually solved by means of a variational ansatz. However, one is usually interested in more than just the ground-state energy, which, after all, is not directly measurable and depends very sensitively on the properties at short distances. Most often we wish to evaluate the long-distance, low-frequency, properties of the correlation and response functions of this theory. Moreover, in some cases, such as in one dimension, the fluctuations overwhelm the MFT predictions.

In this chapter we will consider the standard MFT (i.e. Hartree-Fock), which is expected to become accurate at weak coupling. We will consider both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. We will also rederive these results using path integrals. As a byproduct, we will also have a theory of the fluctuations: the non-linear sigma model.

### 3.1 Mean-field theory

Let us consider now the effects of interactions on the unperturbed ground state. It is convenient to consider the Fourier transform of the interaction term of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, Eq. (2.7)

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{1} & =U \sum_{\vec{r}} n_{\uparrow}(\vec{r}) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{r}) \\
& =U \int_{\vec{k}_{1} \ldots \vec{k}_{4}}(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{d}\left(-\vec{k}_{1}+\vec{k}_{2}-\vec{k}_{3}+\vec{k}_{4}\right) c_{\uparrow}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{k}_{1}\right) c_{\uparrow}\left(\vec{k}_{2}\right) c_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{k}_{3}\right) c_{\downarrow}\left(\vec{k}_{4}\right) \tag{3.1}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 3.1 Scattering processes between right $(R)$ and left ( $L$ ) movers: (a) forward, (b) backward and (c) Umklapp.
where $\int_{\vec{k}_{i}}$ is a shorthand for $\int_{\mathrm{BZ}} d^{d} k_{i} /(2 \pi)^{d}$. Notice that on a lattice momentum is conserved, modulo a reciprocal-lattice vector $\vec{G}$.

Let us discuss first the simpler one-dimensional case. There are two Fermi points (at $\pm k_{\mathrm{F}}$ ). Thus we can classify the excitations as left- or right-moving particles and holes with either spin orientation. We have the following scattering processes (see Fig. 3.1): (a) forward scattering, (b) backward scattering, and (c) Umklapp scattering.

In case (a) two particles scatter with a small momentum transfer and do not change the direction of their individual motion. In case (b) a right mover becomes a left mover and vice versa. In case (c) two right movers become left movers. This process violates momentum conservation but, if the total momentum violation equals a reciprocal-lattice vector, the (Umklapp) process is allowed. This occurs for $k_{\mathrm{F}}=\pi / 2$, which is the half-filled case (see Fig. 3.1(c)).

Case (b), backward scattering, implies a scattering process involving two degenerate states: exchanging a right mover with a left mover and vice versa (see Fig. 3.1(b)). Since the energy denominator is zero we may have an instability of the perturbation theory. This is an antiferromagnetic instability since the momentum transfer is $\pi$. Conversely, instability in the forward-scattering channel is a symptom of ferromagnetism.

In dimensions higher than one, the situation is more complex due to the intricacies of the Fermi surface. For instance, in the case of a half-filled square lattice the Fermi surface is a square (see Fig. 2.4). A scattering process involving the (nesting) wave vectors shown in Fig. 3.2 may induce an antiferromagnetic instability. That is, we exchange particles with opposite spin from opposite sides of the Fermi surface. Once again this involves a momentum exchange of $(\pi, \pi)$ or $(\pi,-\pi)$, depending the case.

However, for a nearly empty band, only quasi-forward scattering should matter, and the relevant momentum exchange should be zero (ferromagnetism). Other
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_21_8c6677f87cb2cf5c3b27g-047.jpg?height=768&width=764&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=468)

Figure 3.2 Nesting vectors for the Brillouin zone of a square lattice at half-filling. This nesting property is responsible for an antiferromagnetic instability.
cases, involving other momentum exchanges, are possible. These instabilities generally give rise to a spin-density wave of wave vector $\vec{k}$. The ferromagnetic state occurs when $\vec{k}=0$ and the Néel antiferromagnetic state occurs when $\vec{k}=(\pi, \pi)$.

We want to develop a theory of these instabilities. As we see, we need to find bound states of a certain wave vector $\vec{k}$ and the ground state will have to be rebuilt in the form of a coherent superposition of these bound states. Since we do not know how to solve this problem exactly, some sort of mean-field theory is necessary. There are several ways of achieving this goal, using (a) the Hartree-Fock and random-phase approximation (RPA), (b) variational wave functions, and (c) $1 / N$ expansions.

These three approaches are, to some extent, physically equivalent. While (a) and (b) (and mostly (a)) are commonly discussed in textbooks, the $1 / N$ expansion is a rather novel technique and, for that reason, is not usually available to students (although it has become pervasive throughout the current literature).

The Hartree-Fock-RPA approach involves choosing a particular set of the Feynman diagrams, which one can argue gives the "most important" contributions. While in one dimension it is possible to select diagrams according to their degree of divergence in the infrared, the situation is far less clear in two or more dimensions. Typically, one has to choose a particular process and sum all the leading contributions which contribute to the process and, at the same time, do not violate any conservation laws, a "conserving approximation," in the terminology of Baym
and Kadanoff (Kadanoff and Baym, 1962). Such is the spirit of Hartree-FockRPA theories. Similarly, in the variational-wave-function approach, one chooses variational states which are essentially inspired by RPA-like calculations.

Let us first discuss a simple form of mean-field theory. We start from the Hubbard Hamiltonian

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=-t \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }-\frac{2}{3} U \sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2} \tag{3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is quartic in the fermionic operators, since

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{2} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \vec{\tau}_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} c_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

(From now on, I will be using the summation convention on repeated spin indices.)
The interaction term of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.2), is quartic in fermion operators. In general a non-linear problem of this sort is not solvable except in some very special cases, such as one-dimensional systems. A standard approach is the mean-field approximation (or Hartree-Fock approximation) in which the quartic term is factorized in terms of a fermion bilinear times a Bose field, which is usually treated classically. In other words one simply ignores the dynamics of the Bose field. Consider, for instance, the Hamiltonian $H^{\prime}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
H^{\prime}=-t \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }+\frac{3}{8 U} \sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{M}^{2}(\vec{r})+\sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{M}(\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{S}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

which can be regarded as a linearized version of $H$ in terms of a Bose field $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$, which, as we will see below, represents the local magnetization.

However, there is something in this expression that is not quite right, since the field $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$ does not have any dynamics. It looks like a variational parameter. Indeed, in the Hartree-Fock approximation, one assumes that a certain operator, say $\vec{S}(\vec{r})$, picks up an expectation value. One then has to shift the operator by its expectation value and neglect fluctuations (this is the mean-field approximation). Therefore, one writes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}(\vec{r})=\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle+(\vec{S}(\vec{r})-\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle) \tag{3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The term in brackets clearly represents fluctuations. Thus

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}^{2}=\langle\vec{S}\rangle^{2}+(\vec{S}-\langle\vec{S}\rangle)^{2}+2\langle\vec{S}\rangle \cdot(\vec{S}-\langle\vec{S}\rangle) \tag{3.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Neglecting fluctuations means that we drop the second term. Thus we write

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=H_{\mathrm{MF}}+H_{\mathrm{fl}} \tag{3.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}= & -t \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }-\frac{2}{3} U \sum_{\vec{r}}\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle^{2} \\
& -\frac{4}{3} U \sum_{\vec{r}}\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle \cdot(\vec{S}(\vec{r})-\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle) \tag{3.8}
\end{align*}
$$

and the fluctuation part $H_{\mathrm{fl}}$ is the rest. We can also write

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=-t \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { h.c. }+\frac{2 U}{3} \sum_{\vec{r}}\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle^{2}-\frac{4 U}{3} \sum_{\vec{r}}\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle \cdot \vec{S}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is just $H^{\prime}$, Eq. (3.4), if we make the identification $\vec{M}(\vec{r}) \equiv-(4 U / 3)\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle$.
We can give dynamics to $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$ by using the following device. Consider first the simple classical oscillator problem with a degree of freedom $\vec{M}$ and Lagrangian

$$
\begin{equation*}
L=\frac{1}{2} m \dot{\vec{M}}^{2}-\frac{g}{2} \vec{M}^{2}-\vec{M} \cdot \vec{S} \tag{3.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

The equations of motion of this oscillator are

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\vec{M}}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{M}} \tag{3.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

which imply

$$
\begin{equation*}
m \ddot{\vec{M}}=-g \vec{M}-\vec{S} \tag{3.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

At the quantum level these equations become the equation of motion of the operator $\vec{M}(t)$ in the Heisenberg representation.

Consider now the limit $m \rightarrow 0$. The only smooth trajectories, i.e. with $\ddot{\vec{M}}$ finite, which are possible in this limit satisfy

$$
\begin{equation*}
g \vec{M}+\vec{S}=0 \tag{3.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

The Hamiltonian $H^{\prime}$ has to be regarded in precisely the same way. We have to add a kinetic-energy term at each site of the form $\sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{P}^{2}(\vec{r}) /(2 m)$, where $\vec{P}$ and $\vec{M}$ obey canonical commutation relations, and consider the limit $m \rightarrow 0$. One should not panic at the apparent divergence in the kinetic-energy term: the equations of motion are taking care of it. We are going to come back to this later on, when we discuss the path-integral form. There everything is simpler.

Thus we see that the Lagrange multiplier field $\vec{M}$ is dynamical in the sense that it follows the configurations of fermions in detail. In mean-field theory (i.e. the Hartree-Fock approximation), one replaces $\vec{M}$ by some static (time-independent) configuration, which, in turn, is determined by the condition that the ground-state energy should be the lowest possible energy.

Let us now look at $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ in Fourier space. The Lagrange multiplier field $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$ has the Fourier transform

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{M}(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{N^{d}} \sum_{\vec{k}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}} \vec{M}(\vec{k}) \rightarrow \int \frac{d^{d} k}{(2 \pi)^{d}} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}} \vec{M}(\vec{k}) \quad \text { for } \quad N \rightarrow \infty \tag{3.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can now write $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=\int_{\vec{k}}\left(\sum_{\sigma} \epsilon(\vec{k}) n_{\sigma}(\vec{k})+\frac{3}{8 U}|\vec{M}(\vec{k})|^{2}+\vec{M}^{*}(\vec{k}) \cdot \vec{S}(\vec{k})\right) \tag{3.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

since

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{M}(\vec{k})=\vec{M}^{*}(-\vec{k}) \tag{3.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

and where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}(\vec{k})=\int_{\vec{k}^{\prime}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{k}^{\prime}\right) \frac{\vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta}}{2} c_{\beta}\left(\vec{k}^{\prime}+\vec{k}\right) \tag{3.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $\epsilon(\vec{k})=-2 t \sum_{j=1}^{d} \cos k_{j}$.
The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.15) implies that a configuration with the Fourier component $\vec{M}(\vec{k})$ induces scattering processes which mix oneparticle states differing by $\vec{k}$.

### 3.1.1 The ferromagnetic state

Let us consider first the ferromagnetic solution in which $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$ is a constant $\vec{M}_{0}$. In Fourier space, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{M}(\vec{k})=\vec{M}_{0}(2 \pi)^{d} \delta^{d}(\vec{k}) \tag{3.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ is (with the volume $V=N^{d}$ )

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=\frac{3}{8 U} V \vec{M}_{0}^{2}+\int_{\vec{k}}\left(\epsilon(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{k})+c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) \frac{\vec{\tau}_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}}{2} c_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}) \cdot \vec{M}_{0}\right) \tag{3.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the direction of $\vec{M}_{0}$ is arbitrary, one can choose the $z$ axis (i.e. the quantization axis) to be parallel to $\vec{M}_{0}$ without any loss of generality. One then finds

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=\frac{3}{8 U} V \vec{M}_{0}^{2}+\int_{\vec{k}}\left[\left(\epsilon(\vec{k})+\frac{1}{2}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|\right) n_{\uparrow}(\vec{k})+\left(\epsilon(\vec{k})-\frac{1}{2}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|\right) n_{\downarrow}(\vec{k})\right] \tag{3.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

The result is that, if $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|$ is non-zero, we can lower the electronic energy by filling up a number of down spin states and, at the same time, emptying the same number of up spin states. Since the first term penalizes a non-zero value of $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|$ we must search for a balance. We also need to keep track of the fact that there is a total of
$N$ electrons (both those with up and those with down spins). As usual, this is taken care of by shifting $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ by $\mu \hat{N}=\mu \sum_{\vec{r}} c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{r})$.

Consider now a state with $N_{\uparrow}$ electrons with spin up and $N_{\downarrow}$ with spin down. Let $\epsilon_{\uparrow}\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}\right)$ be the one-particle energy of the top of the filled up (down) states. The total energy of such a state $E$ is a function of $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|, \mu, \epsilon_{\uparrow}$, and $\epsilon_{\downarrow}$ (or, equivalently $N_{\uparrow}$ and $N_{\downarrow}$ ).

The energy is $\left(\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right| \equiv M_{0}\right)$

$$
\begin{align*}
E_{0}\left(M_{0}, \mu, \epsilon_{\uparrow}, \epsilon_{\downarrow}\right)= & \frac{3}{8 U} V M_{0}^{2}+V \int_{\vec{k}}\left(\epsilon(\vec{k})+\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \theta\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow}-\epsilon(\vec{k})\right) \\
& +V \int_{\vec{k}}\left(\epsilon(\vec{k})-\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \theta\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\epsilon(\vec{k})\right) \\
& +\mu V \int_{\vec{k}}\left(\theta\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow}-\epsilon(\vec{k})\right)+\theta\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\epsilon(\vec{k})\right)\right) \tag{3.21}
\end{align*}
$$

By introducing the one-particle band density of states (DOS) (i.e. the DOS of the unperturbed system without spin), $\rho(\epsilon)$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E} \equiv & \frac{E_{0}}{V} \\
= & \frac{3}{8 U} M_{0}^{2}+\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon\left(\epsilon+\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \rho(\epsilon)+\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon\left(\epsilon-\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \rho(\epsilon) \\
& +\mu\left(\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)+\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)\right) \tag{3.22}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\epsilon_{0}$ is the energy of the bottom of the band.
Since the ground-state energy must be an extremum (actually a minimum) we have to find the values of $\mu, M_{0}, \epsilon_{\uparrow}$, and $\epsilon_{\downarrow}$ which make the energy density have a minimum at fixed density. That is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \mu}=\frac{N}{V}, \quad \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|}=0, \quad \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \epsilon_{\uparrow}}=0, \quad \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \epsilon_{\downarrow}}=0 \tag{3.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

An explicit calculation gives

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{N}{V} & =\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)+\int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \\
0 & =\frac{3}{4 U} M_{0}+\frac{1}{2} \int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)-\frac{1}{2} \int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \\
0 & =\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow}+\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \rho\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow}\right)+\mu \rho\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow}\right)  \tag{3.24}\\
0 & =\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\frac{1}{2} M_{0}\right) \rho\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}\right)+\mu \rho\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

Provided that $\rho\left(\epsilon_{\uparrow, \downarrow}\right) \neq 0$, we see that the polarization $M_{0}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
M_{0}=\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\epsilon_{\uparrow} \tag{3.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the chemical potential $\mu$ is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_{\downarrow}+\epsilon_{\uparrow}\right) \tag{3.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Clearly, since $M_{0}$ is positive, $\epsilon_{\uparrow}<\epsilon_{\downarrow}$ and there are more occupied down spin states than up spin states. We can also write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\epsilon_{\uparrow}=\frac{2 U}{3} \int_{\epsilon_{\uparrow}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \tag{3.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{N}{V}=2 \int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)+\int_{\epsilon_{\uparrow}}^{\epsilon_{\downarrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \tag{3.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations (3.27) and (3.28) determine $\epsilon_{\uparrow}$ and $\epsilon_{\downarrow}$ and, thus, the solution to the problem. In general these equations need to be solved numerically.

Equation (3.27) has two solutions: $\epsilon_{\uparrow}=\epsilon_{\downarrow}$ (i.e. $M_{0}=0$, the paramagnetic state) and $\epsilon_{\uparrow} \neq \epsilon_{\downarrow}\left(M_{0} \neq 0\right.$, the ferromagnetic state $)$. The analysis of these equations follows closely the solution of the Curie-Weiss equation in the theory of phase transitions. We can write Eq. (3.27) in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{2 U}{3} \int_{0}^{x} d \epsilon \rho\left(\epsilon+\epsilon_{\uparrow}\right) \tag{3.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $x=\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\epsilon_{\uparrow}$. Also, we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{N}{V}=2 \int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)+\frac{3}{2 U} x \tag{3.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

For $\epsilon_{\uparrow}$ given, the integral in Eq. (3.29) is a monotonically increasing function of $x$ (see Fig. 3.3). For values of $U>U_{\mathrm{c}}$ there are two solutions $x_{0}=0$ and $x_{0} \neq 0$, whereas for $U<U_{\mathrm{c}}$ there is only one solution, $x_{0}=0$. The critical Hubbard coupling $U_{\mathrm{c}}$ is determined by the condition

$$
\begin{equation*}
1=\frac{2 U_{\mathrm{c}}}{3} \rho\left(\bar{\epsilon}_{\uparrow}\right) \tag{3.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\rho\left(\bar{\epsilon}_{\uparrow}\right)$ is determined by Eq. (3.30) at $x=0$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{N}{V}=2 \int_{\epsilon_{0}}^{\bar{\epsilon}_{\uparrow}} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \tag{3.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (3.31) is known as the Stoner criterion. The statement is that for $U>U_{\text {c }}$ the ferromagnetic solution appears and has a lower energy than the paramagnetic state, $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|=0$.

Figure 3.3 Solution of the mean-field equation.

If the DOS is a smooth function near the Fermi energy of the paramagnetic state, we can find the solution close to $U_{\mathrm{c}}$ by using a power-series expansion. The result, to leading order in $\left(U_{\mathrm{c}}-U\right) / U_{\mathrm{c}}$, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{0}=\epsilon_{\downarrow}-\bar{\epsilon}_{\uparrow} \approx \frac{2 \bar{\rho}}{\bar{\rho}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{U_{\mathrm{c}}-U}{U_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)+\cdots \tag{3.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\delta=\epsilon_{\uparrow}-\overline{\epsilon_{\uparrow}} \approx-\frac{3}{2 U_{\mathrm{c}} \bar{\rho}^{\prime}}\left(\frac{U_{\mathrm{c}}-U}{U_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)+\cdots \tag{3.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\overline{\epsilon_{\uparrow}}$ satisfies Eq. (3.32) and $\bar{\rho}$ and $\bar{\rho}^{\prime}$ are the DOS and its derivative at $\overline{\epsilon_{\uparrow}}$. There are important cases in which the DOS $\rho(\epsilon)$ has singularities at certain energies known as the van Hove singularities. This happens at half-filling for systems like a square lattice, for which the Fermi surface has the property of nesting.

### 3.1.2 The Néel state

We now will look for solutions of the mean-field equations in which $\vec{M}(\vec{r})$ is not a constant. Ultimately the problem boils down to a comparison of the energies for different solutions. However, for situations in which nesting takes place we can argue that a Néel state, or, more generally, a spin-density wave (SDW), is the ground state.

Let us consider the mean-field Hamiltonian of Eq. (3.15) and assume that $M(\vec{r})$ has the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{M}(\vec{r})=\vec{M}_{0} \cos (\vec{Q} \cdot \vec{r}) \tag{3.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_21_8c6677f87cb2cf5c3b27g-054.jpg?height=764&width=770&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=470)

Figure 3.4 The first Brillouin zone for the square lattice for a nearest-neighbor hopping band structure. The diamond-shaped full curve is the Fermi surface (FS) at half-filling with Fermi energy $E_{\mathrm{F}}=0 . \Gamma$ is an FS with $E_{\mathrm{F}}<0$, and $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ is an FS with $E_{\mathrm{F}}>0$. The black dots are the van Hove singularities at the saddle-points of the dispersion $E(\vec{k})$.
where $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$. We saw before that, at half-filling, the Fermi surface (FS) has the shape shown in Fig. 2.4; see here Fig. 3.4. The states across the FS differ by a wave vector $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$, which is at the Brillouin-zone (BZ) edge (this is the nesting property). Furthermore, for a square lattice, we have $\epsilon(\vec{k})=-2 t\left(\cos k_{1}+\right.$ $\left.\cos k_{2}\right)$. Thus we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon(\vec{k})=-\epsilon(\vec{k}+\vec{Q}) \tag{3.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

The mean-field Hamiltonian can now be written in the form

$$
\begin{align*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}= & \frac{3}{8 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2} V+\int_{\vec{k}} \epsilon(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) c_{\sigma}(\vec{k}) \\
& +\int_{\vec{k}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) \frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} c_{\beta}(\vec{k}+\vec{Q}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \vec{M}_{0} \\
& +\int_{\vec{k}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) \frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} c_{\beta}(\vec{k}-\vec{Q}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \vec{M}_{0} \tag{3.37}
\end{align*}
$$

Consider the spinor $\Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{k})$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{k})=\binom{c_{\sigma}(\vec{k})}{c_{\sigma}(\vec{k}+\vec{Q})} \tag{3.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we restrict ourselves to the two-dimensional case we can now write

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=\frac{3}{8 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2} V+\int_{\vec{k}}^{\prime} \Psi_{a \sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) \mathcal{H}_{a \sigma, a^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}) \Psi_{a^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}(\vec{k}) \tag{3.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the integral now ranges over the upper half of the BZ (it has been "folded") and $a=1,2$ and $\sigma=\uparrow, \downarrow$, indicating the upper and lower components of $\Psi$ with either spin. The one-particle Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ is a $4 \times 4$ matrix that has the block form

$$
\mathcal{H}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\epsilon(\vec{k}) & \frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{M}_{0}  \tag{3.40}\\
\frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{M}_{0} & \epsilon(\vec{k}+\vec{Q})
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\epsilon(\vec{k}) & \frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{M}_{0} \\
\frac{1}{2} \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{M}_{0} & -\epsilon(\vec{k})
\end{array}\right)
$$

This matrix can be diagonalized very easily (see, for instance, the diagonalization of the Dirac Hamiltonian). It has two doubly degenerate (spin) eigenvalues $E_{ \pm}(\vec{k})$ with

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{ \pm}= \pm \sqrt{\epsilon^{2}(\vec{k})+\frac{1}{4}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2}} \tag{3.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we see that the system has now acquired a gap $\Delta$ with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta=\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right| \tag{3.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

at the "Fermi surface."
The ground state is obtained by filling up the negative-energy single-particle fermionic states with spins both up and down. This state has a vanishing $z$ component of the total spin: $S_{z}=0$. The energy density is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=\frac{3}{8 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2}-\int_{\vec{k}}^{\prime} E_{+}(\vec{k}) \tag{3.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the integral ranges over the occupied states in the upper half of the first BZ. We can now use the symmetries of $E(\vec{k}) \equiv E_{+}(\vec{k})$ to write this expression in terms of an integral over the upper-right quadrant of the BZ

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=\frac{3}{8 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2}-2 \int_{\Omega} E(\vec{k}) \tag{3.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the integration range is the set of points of the first $\mathrm{BZ} \Omega=\left\{\vec{k}, 0 \leq k_{i} \leq\right.$ $\left.\pi, k_{1}+k_{2} \leq \pi\right\}$.

We must now determine the value of $M_{0}$ for which $\mathcal{E}$ is lowest. The condition for an extremum is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial M_{0}}=\frac{3}{4 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|-2 \int_{\Omega} \frac{d^{2} k}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{\partial E(\vec{k})}{\partial M_{0}}=0 \tag{3.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

Clearly we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{4 U}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|-\frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \frac{d^{2} k}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|}{E(\vec{k})}=0 \tag{3.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

One solution is $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|=0$ (i.e. no long-range order). This is the paramagnetic state. The other solution obeys the gap equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{2 U}=\int_{\Omega} \frac{d^{2} k}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}(\vec{k})+\frac{1}{4}\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|^{2}}} \tag{3.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the case of the square lattice (although similar results hold for other cases with nesting) the integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.47) is divergent (for $M_{0} \rightarrow 0$ ). In fact, the integral is dominated by contributions with momenta close to the FS, i.e. near $k_{1}+k_{2}=\pi$, or for single-particle states with energy close to the Fermi energy ( $E_{\mathrm{F}}=0$ in this case). The simplest way to evaluate Eq. (3.47) is to write the momentum integral as an integral over the energies $\varepsilon$ of the occupied single-particle states:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{2 U}=\int_{E_{\min }}^{E_{\mathrm{F}}} d \varepsilon \frac{\rho(\varepsilon)}{\sqrt{\varepsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}}} \tag{3.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\rho(\varepsilon)$ is the one-particle DOS (per unit volume) for the single-particle disper$\operatorname{sion} \epsilon(\vec{k})=-2 t\left(\cos k_{1}+\cos k_{2}\right)$, and $\Delta=\frac{1}{2} M_{0}$ is the single-particle gap. Here, $E_{\mathrm{F}}=0$ and $E_{\min }=-4 t$.

The single-particle DOS can always be written as a line integral over a closed contour $\Gamma(\varepsilon)$ (the set of points with energy $\varepsilon$ )

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho(\varepsilon)=\frac{2}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \oint_{\Gamma(\varepsilon)} \frac{d \vec{l} \cdot \hat{n}}{|\vec{v}|}=\frac{1}{2 \pi^{2}} \oint_{\Gamma(\varepsilon)} \frac{d \vec{k} \cdot \vec{\nabla}_{k} \varepsilon(\vec{k})}{\left|\nabla_{k} \varepsilon(\vec{k})\right|^{2}} \tag{3.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{v}=\vec{\nabla}_{k} \varepsilon(\vec{k})$ and $\hat{n}$ is the unit tangent vector, $\hat{n}=\vec{v} /|\vec{v}|$. If the $\operatorname{DOS} \rho(\varepsilon)$ is a smooth function of the energy $\varepsilon$ near the Fermi energy $E_{\mathrm{F}}$, the integral of Eq. (3.48) would be logarithmically divergent as the gap $\Delta \rightarrow 0$. However, for the case of the square lattice the DOS is singular for $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.

The FS of the half-filled square lattice has $E_{\mathrm{F}}=0$ and hence it separates electron-like states with $E>0$ from hole-like states with $E<0$. The point $(0,0)$ of the BZ is the minimum energy (for single-particle states) whereas the point $(\pi, \pi)$ (and others related by reciprocal lattice vectors) are maxima of the dispersion. Of particular interest are the points $(\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \pi)$ (and their images under reciprocal-lattice translations) that are saddle-points of the dispersion. It turns out that the one-particle DOS is logarithmically divergent at these saddle-points, which are examples of van Hove singularities. An explicit evaluation of the integral of

Eq. (3.49) shows that the most singular contributions are due to the vicinity of the van Hove singularities, yielding the logarithmically divergent result

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho(\varepsilon)=\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2} t} \ln \left(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\right)+\cdots \quad \text { as } \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 \tag{3.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

The mean-field (gap) equation, Eq. (3.47), becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{2 U} \simeq \int_{\Delta}^{E_{\max }} \frac{d \varepsilon}{\varepsilon} \frac{1}{4 \pi^{2} t} \ln \left(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\right) \tag{3.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

Upon evaluating this integral we find that the gap $\Delta$ for single-particle states in a Néel antiferromagnetic state is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta=2 \pi^{2} t e^{-\sqrt{\frac{12 t}{U}}} \tag{3.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

We conclude that the order parameter $\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle$ is also non-zero: $\langle\vec{S}(\vec{r})\rangle=$ $[3 /(8 U)] \vec{M}_{0} \cos (\vec{Q} \cdot \vec{r})$. Thus an antiferromagnetic solution is found even for arbitrarily weak Hubbard coupling $U$. Please keep in mind that the ferromagnetic solution requires a finite value of $U$ to exist. It is also easy to see that this Néel state has less energy than that of the paramagnetic state $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|=0$. Thus, at least at half-filling, the ground state appears to be a Néel antiferromagnet.

This solution is also remarkable for other reasons. First, the dependence of $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|$ on $U$ is highly non-analytic: we get an essential singularity. This is exactly analogous (albeit with a stronger singularity) to what one finds in BCS theory and in the case of the Peierls instability of one-dimensional electron-phonon systems (see Section 16.7). Secondly, the electronic spectrum has a gap $\Delta$, which is equal to $\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|$. Thus the gap also has an essential singularity in the coupling constant. But is the spectrum truly massive? Are there any gapless (or massless) excitations present? What this calculation says is that the one-particle spectrum is massive. What about the two-particle spectrum? We will see below that there are massless spin waves, in agreement with Goldstone's theorem.

### 3.2 Path-integral representation of the Hubbard model

So far we have discussed some features of these systems within a mean-field theory that is based on the canonical Hamiltonian formalism. It is possible to gain further insight by going to the path-integral form. These two representations are equivalent and certainly whatever one can do in one form can be reproduced in the other picture. However, certain aspects of the problem can be dealt with in a more natural and concise way in the path-integral picture. The questions relating to the symmetry, and its breaking, effective theories for the low-lying modes, etc., are more answerable in path-integral form. Also, of course, the semi-classical
treatment, including non-perturbative features such as solitons and the like, is very simple to picture in terms of path integrals.

Typically we are interested in studying both zero-temperature and finite-temperature properties of the system. At finite temperature, the equilibrium properties are determined by the partition function

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\operatorname{tr} e^{-\beta H} \tag{3.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\beta=1 / T$ (in units in which $k_{\mathrm{B}}=1$ ). Usually, one would also like to know the behavior of the correlation functions.

At zero temperature one is interested in the "vacuum persistence amplitude" (Coleman, 1985)

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \operatorname{tr} e^{i H t} \tag{3.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is just the trace of the evolution operator at long times. Feynman showed (Feynman and Hibbs, 1965) that Eq. (3.54) can be written as a sum over histories. Also, it is apparent that Eq. (3.53) is related to Eq. (3.54) by an analytic continuation procedure known as "Wick rotation,"

$$
\begin{equation*}
i t=-\tau \tag{3.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

which amounts to going to imaginary time (Abrikosov et al., 1963). I will use both forms more or less simultaneously.

I do not intend to give a thorough description of the path-integral method. Qualitatively, the path integral is derived as follows. Let $H$ be the Hamiltonian of the system and $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ be a set of states. In most cases we will demand that $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ be a complete set of states. However, it will also be convenient to work with a system of coherent states that is over-complete. In either case, what matters is the existence of an identity of the form ("resolution of unity")

$$
\begin{equation*}
1=N \int d \alpha|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| \tag{3.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $N$ is a normalization constant and $d \alpha$ is an integration measure. It is worthwhile to comment that the states $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ need not be position eigenstates. In the usual derivation ("sum over histories") the position-space (or coordinate) representation is used. On the other hand, in many problems, such as the quantization of spin systems, there isn't a natural separation between canonical coordinates and momenta. Thus the space of states $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ can be quite general and abstract. In fact the coherent-state representation is in a sense more primitive (or fundamental).

The standard strategy that one employs is the following. First one defines the states $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$. In the case of a many-body system such as the Hubbard model, these states should be antisymmetrized many-fermion states. I will work in the grand canonical ensemble and, hence, use second quantization. The need to
antisymmetrize the states will bring some complications, which will be taken care of by using Grassmann variables.

The second step is to split up the time interval $t$ into $N_{t}$ segments of infinitesimal length $\Delta_{t}$ such that $N_{t} \Delta_{t}=t$. The same prescription applies to the imaginary time (Euclidean) formalism. The vacuum persistence amplitude is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\operatorname{tr} \hat{T} e^{i \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d t H(t)} \tag{3.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{T}$ is the time-ordering operator. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.57) reduces to Eq. (3.54). For infinitesimal intervals $\Delta_{t} \rightarrow 0$ we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\operatorname{tr} \hat{T} e^{i \sum_{j=1}^{N_{t}} \Delta_{t} H\left(t_{j}\right)} \approx \operatorname{tr} \hat{T} \prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}} e^{i \Delta_{t} H\left(t_{j}\right)} \tag{3.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now we proceed by inserting the resolution of unity, Eq. (3.56), at each intermediate time $t_{j}$. Let $\left\{\left|\alpha_{j}\right\rangle\right\}$ be a set of states at each time $t_{j}$. We get

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\sum_{\left\{\alpha_{j}\right\}} \prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}}\left\langle\alpha_{j}\right| e^{-i \Delta_{t} H\left(t_{j}\right)}\left|\alpha_{j+1}\right\rangle \tag{3.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $\left|\alpha_{N+1}\right\rangle=\left|\alpha_{1}\right\rangle$ and where $\left|\alpha_{j}\right\rangle \equiv\left|\alpha\left(t_{j}\right)\right\rangle$ are the states at time $t_{j}$.
We can regard the $\alpha\left(t_{j}\right)$ as a set of parameters spanning a manifold defining the states $\left|\alpha_{j}\right\rangle$. Thus what we actually have is a sum over configurations $\{\alpha(t)\}$. Notice that this procedure is absolutely general. We are supposed to take the limit $\Delta_{t} \rightarrow 0, N_{t} \rightarrow \infty$ at the end. That this limit exists is a highly non-trivial issue and certainly not a formal matter. This procedure applies both for single-particle problems and for states of a many-body second-quantized system, i.e. a field theory.

Let us first review the simple particle in a potential problem. In this case the Hamiltonian is

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=\frac{\hat{p}^{2}}{2 m}+V(\hat{q}) \tag{3.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$ obey canonical commutation relations $(\hbar=1)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
[\hat{q}, \hat{p}]=i \tag{3.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the states $|\alpha\rangle$ can be the complete set of position eigenstates $|q\rangle$. The resolution of the identity is

$$
\begin{equation*}
1=\int d q|q\rangle\langle q| \tag{3.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

Conversely, we could also use momentum eigenstates. The momentum operator $\hat{p}$ is not diagonal in this basis. Thus the amplitude

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle q\left(t_{j}\right)\right| e^{i \Delta_{t} H}\left|q\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right\rangle \tag{3.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

can be written in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle q\left(t_{j}\right)\right| e^{i \Delta_{t} \frac{\hat{p}^{2}}{2 m}}\left|q\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right\rangle e^{i \Delta_{t} V\left(q\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right)} \tag{3.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have used the fact that $\hat{V}$ is diagonal in the coordinate representation. Now we use a complete set of momentum eigenstates $\left\{\left|p\left(t_{j}\right)\right\rangle\right\}$ and write

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{i \Delta_{t} \frac{\hat{p}^{2}}{2 m}}=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d p}{2 \pi} e^{i \Delta_{t} \frac{p^{2}\left(t_{j}\right)}{2 m}}\left|p\left(t_{j}\right)\right\rangle\left\langle p\left(t_{j}\right)\right| \tag{3.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

On collecting these various contributions we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} p \mathcal{D} q \prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}} e^{i \Delta_{t} \frac{p^{2}\left(t_{j}\right)}{2 m}+i \Delta_{t} V\left(q\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right)}\left\langle p\left(t_{j}\right) \mid q\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right\rangle\left\langle p\left(t_{j}\right) \mid q\left(t_{j}\right)\right\rangle^{*} \tag{3.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

where I used the definition of the measure

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{D} p \mathcal{D} q=\prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}} \frac{d p\left(t_{j}\right) d q\left(t_{j}\right)}{2 \pi} \tag{3.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we can write Eq. (3.66) in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} p \mathcal{D} q e^{-i \int d t[p \dot{q}-H(p, q)]} \tag{3.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

by making use of the fact that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle p \mid q\rangle=e^{-i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{q}} \tag{3.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (3.68) is nothing but a sum over the configurations in the phase space of the action $S$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
S=\int d t(p \dot{q}-H) \tag{3.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

of each configuration. Since we are computing a trace the field $q(t)$ obeys periodic boundary conditions in time. Note that $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$ do not commute. The phase-space integral is actually a coherent-state path integral (Faddeev, 1976). Equation (3.68) is generally valid even for Hamiltonians for which it is not possible to clearly separate coordinates and momenta. I will adopt the phase-space (or coherent-state) path integral as the definition.

This procedure can be trivially generalized to second-quantized systems. In the case of bosons we have second-quantized field operators $\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r})$ and $\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\vec{r})$ and a Hamiltonian $H$. The field operators obey the equal-time commutation relations

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left[\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r}), \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)\right]=\delta\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{3.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

Consider the classical Lagrangian $L$

$$
\begin{equation*}
L=\sum_{\vec{r}} \Psi^{*} i \partial_{t} \Psi-H \tag{3.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

The commutation relations in Eq. (3.71) follow from canonically quantizing $L$. The canonical momentum $\hat{\Pi}(\vec{r})$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\Pi}(\vec{r}) \equiv \frac{\delta L}{\delta \partial_{t} \hat{\Psi}(\vec{r})} \equiv i \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus the canonical commutation relations

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left[\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r}), \hat{\Pi}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)\right]=i \delta\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{3.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

are equivalent to Eq. (3.71) after $\hat{\Pi}$ has been identified with $i \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}$.
A discussion analogous to what we did for the particle case yields a phase-space path integral

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} \Psi^{*} \mathcal{D} \Psi e^{i \int d t\left[\sum_{\vec{r}} \Psi^{*} i \partial_{t} \Psi-H\left(\Psi^{*}, \Psi\right)\right]} \tag{3.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Psi$ and $\Psi^{*}$ are complex c-number fields that parametrize the coherent states (Faddeev, 1976). Since we are dealing with bosons, the fields $\Psi$ are c-numbers and commute. The boundary conditions in turn are periodic. The case of fermions can also be dealt with, provided that one takes care of the anti-commuting nature of fermion operators.

It is convenient to introduce coherent states for fermions. Let $\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}$ and $\hat{\Psi}$ be Fermi creation and annihilation operators that satisfy

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\{\hat{\Psi}, \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}\right\}=1 \tag{3.76}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\Psi}^{2}=\left(\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}\right)^{2}=0 \tag{3.77}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the occupation-number representation we have two states, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, with the properties

$$
\begin{align*}
& \hat{\Psi}|0\rangle=0, \quad \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=|1\rangle, \quad \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} \hat{\Psi}|0\rangle=0,  \tag{3.78}\\
& \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|1\rangle=0, \quad \hat{\Psi}|1\rangle=|0\rangle, \quad \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} \hat{\Psi}|1\rangle=|1\rangle
\end{align*}
$$

We introduce the two Grassmann numbers $\Psi$ and $\bar{\Psi}$ that we will associate with the Fermi operators $\hat{\Psi}$ and $\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}$. Their defining property is the (Grassmann) algebra

$$
\begin{equation*}
\{\Psi, \Psi\}=\{\bar{\Psi}, \bar{\Psi}\}=\{\Psi, \bar{\Psi}\}=0 \tag{3.79}
\end{equation*}
$$

that they satisfy. It is natural to extend these anticommutation relations by imposing (Negele and Orland, 1988)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\{\Psi, \hat{\Psi}\}=0 \quad \text { and } \quad(\Psi \hat{\Psi})^{\dagger}=\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} \bar{\Psi} \tag{3.80}
\end{equation*}
$$

We define the coherent state $|\Psi\rangle$ in terms of the Grassmann number $\Psi$

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle \equiv|0\rangle-\Psi|1\rangle=|0\rangle-\Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|0\rangle \tag{3.81}
\end{equation*}
$$

With the help of Eqs. (3.79) and (3.80) we obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
|\Psi\rangle & =\left(1-\Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle \equiv e^{-\Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}}|0\rangle  \tag{3.82}\\
\hat{\Psi}|\Psi\rangle & =\hat{\Psi}|0\rangle-\hat{\Psi} \Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=\Psi|0\rangle=\Psi|\Psi\rangle \tag{3.83}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|\Psi\rangle=\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|0\rangle-\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} \Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=|1\rangle \equiv-\frac{\delta}{\delta \Psi}|\Psi\rangle \tag{3.84}
\end{equation*}
$$

As usual the exponential on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.82) is defined as a power expansion in $\Psi \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}$ and Eq. (3.84) defines operationally the "left" Grassmann derivative.

The adjoint coherent state $\langle\Psi|$ is defined in terms of the Grassmann number $\Psi$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\Psi| \equiv\langle 0|-\langle 1| \bar{\Psi}=\langle 0|-\langle 0| \hat{\Psi} \bar{\Psi} \tag{3.85}
\end{equation*}
$$

As before

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\Psi| & =\langle 0|(1-\hat{\Psi} \bar{\Psi}) \equiv\langle 0| e^{-\hat{\Psi} \bar{\Psi}}  \tag{3.86}\\
\langle\Psi| \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} & =\langle 0| \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}-\langle 0| \hat{\Psi} \bar{\Psi} \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}=\langle 0| \bar{\Psi}=\langle\Psi| \bar{\Psi} \tag{3.87}
\end{align*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\Psi| \hat{\Psi}=\langle 0| \hat{\Psi}-\langle 0| \hat{\Psi} \bar{\Psi} \hat{\Psi}=\langle 1| \equiv-\langle\Psi| \frac{\delta}{\delta \bar{\Psi}} \tag{3.88}
\end{equation*}
$$

The right-hand side of Eq. (3.88) defines the "right" Grassmann derivative in complete analogy to Eq. (3.84). It is natural to require that the "left" ("right") derivative $\delta / \delta \Psi$ anti-commutes with $\Psi$ so that $(\delta / \delta \Psi) \Psi=-\Psi(\delta / \delta \Psi)$.

From Eqs. (3.86), (3.82), and (3.80) the inner product $\left\langle\Psi \mid \Psi^{\prime}\right\rangle$ is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle\Psi \mid \Psi^{\prime}\right\rangle=e^{\bar{\Psi} \Psi^{\prime}} \tag{3.89}
\end{equation*}
$$

This, together with Eqs. (3.83) and (3.87), gives for the matrix elements of a normal-ordered operator: $\mathcal{U}\left(\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}, \hat{\Psi}\right)$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\Psi|: \mathcal{U}\left(\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}, \hat{\Psi}\right):\left|\Psi^{\prime}\right\rangle=\mathcal{U}\left(\bar{\Psi}, \Psi^{\prime}\right) e^{\bar{\Psi} \Psi^{\prime}} \tag{3.90}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{U}\left(\bar{\Psi}, \Psi^{\prime}\right)$ is obtained by carrying out the replacements $\hat{\Psi} \rightarrow \Psi$ and $\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger} \rightarrow$ $\bar{\Psi}$ inside the normal-ordered operator: $\mathcal{U}$ :.

The resolution of unity in this representation is just

$$
\begin{equation*}
1=\int d \bar{\Psi} d \Psi e^{-\bar{\Psi} \Psi}|\Psi\rangle\langle\Psi| \tag{3.91}
\end{equation*}
$$

This identity can be checked by computing the inner product $\left\langle\Psi^{\prime} \mid \Psi^{\prime \prime}\right\rangle$, where $\Psi^{\prime}$ and $\Psi^{\prime \prime}$ are the Grassmann variables $\Psi$ or $\bar{\Psi}$. The integrals in Eq. (3.91) are understood to be linear functionals on the space of functions of the Grassmann variables with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int d \Psi \Psi \equiv 1, \quad \int d \Psi \equiv 0 \tag{3.92}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can now repeat the procedure outlined at the beginning of this section for a second-quantized system of fermions except that now we will use fermion coherent states $\left|\left\{\Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right\}\right\rangle$ at each site and for each spin degree of freedom

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\left\{\Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right\}\right\rangle=\exp \left(-\sum_{\vec{r}, \sigma} \Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \hat{\Psi}_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r})\right)|0\rangle \tag{3.93}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $|0\rangle$ is the empty state (not the "vacuum," as we will see in Chapter 5). Following our noses, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\lim _{\substack{N_{t} \rightarrow \infty \\ \Delta_{t} \rightarrow 0}}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}} \int d \bar{\Psi}\left(t_{j}\right) d \Psi\left(t_{j}\right)\right) \prod_{j=1}^{N_{t}} e^{-\bar{\Psi}\left(t_{j}\right) \Psi\left(t_{j}\right)}\left\langle\Psi\left(t_{j}\right)\right|\left(1-i \Delta_{t} H\right)\left|\Psi\left(t_{j+1}\right)\right\rangle \tag{3.94}
\end{equation*}
$$

where, for the sake of simplicity, I have dropped the space and spin labels. In the limit $N_{t} \rightarrow \infty$ and $\Delta_{t} \rightarrow 0$, one finds

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} \bar{\Psi} \mathcal{D} \Psi e^{i \int d t L} \tag{3.95}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $L$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
L=\sum_{\vec{r}} \bar{\Psi}_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) i \partial_{t} \Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r})-H\left(\bar{\Psi}_{\sigma}(\vec{r}), \Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\right) \tag{3.96}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the case of the Hubbard model, or any other model, for that matter, and in the presence of a non-zero chemical potential $\mu$, we get (see Eq. (2.25))

$$
\begin{equation*}
L=\sum_{\vec{r}} \bar{\Psi}_{\sigma}(\vec{r})\left(i \partial_{t}+\mu\right) \Psi_{\sigma}(\vec{r})+t \sum_{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle} \bar{\Psi}_{\sigma}(\vec{r}) \Psi_{\sigma}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)-H_{\mathrm{int}}(\bar{\Psi}, \Psi) \tag{3.97}
\end{equation*}
$$

From Eq. (2.24) the interaction term of the Hubbard model is

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{int}}=-\frac{U}{6} \sum_{\vec{r}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \tau_{\alpha \beta}^{a} c_{\beta}(\vec{r}) c_{\gamma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \tau_{\gamma \delta}^{a} c_{\delta}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.98}
\end{equation*}
$$

Normal ordering relative to the empty state $|0\rangle$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
: H_{\mathrm{int}}:=-\frac{U}{6} \sum_{\vec{r}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\gamma}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\delta}(\vec{r}) c_{\beta}(\vec{r}) \tau_{\alpha \beta}^{a} \tau_{\gamma \delta}^{a}-\frac{U}{2} \sum_{\vec{r}} c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) c_{\alpha}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.99}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus $H_{\text {int }}(\bar{\Psi}, \Psi)$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm{int}}(\bar{\Psi}, \Psi)=-\frac{U}{6} \sum_{\vec{r}} \bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}) \bar{\Psi}_{\gamma}(\vec{r}) \Psi_{\delta}(\vec{r}) \Psi_{\beta}(\vec{r}) \tau_{\alpha \beta}^{a} \tau_{\gamma \delta}^{a}-\frac{U}{2} \sum_{\vec{r}} \bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}) \Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.100}
\end{equation*}
$$

The last term on the right-hand side can obviously be cancelled out by means of a shift of the chemical potential $\mu$.

The final property of Grassmann integrals which will be useful for us is the integral for actions that are quadratic in the fields,

$$
\begin{equation*}
S=\sum_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \bar{\Psi}(\vec{r}) M\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \Psi\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \tag{3.101}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $M\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right)$ is an antisymmetric matrix (operator). We get the Gaussian integral

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} \bar{\Psi} \mathcal{D} \Psi e^{-\int \bar{\Psi} M \Psi}=\operatorname{det} M \tag{3.102}
\end{equation*}
$$

This expression should be contrasted with the analogous result for bosonic fields $\phi$

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} \phi^{*} \mathcal{D} \phi e^{-\int \phi^{*} M \phi}=(\operatorname{det} M)^{-1} \tag{3.103}
\end{equation*}
$$

Both results can be derived quite easily by expanding $\Psi$ and $\bar{\Psi}$ in a basis of eigenstates of $M$, see Faddeev (1976) or Negele and Orland (1988).

### 3.3 Path integrals and mean-field theory

We now turn to the mean-field theory for the Hubbard model in path-integral form. The advantage of this description is that we will be able to extract an effective-field theory for the low-lying modes in the Néel state: spin waves.

The Lagrangian density for the Hubbard model in two dimensions, in real time and at zero temperature is, from Eqs. (3.97) and (3.100),

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}= & \bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t)\left(i \partial_{t}+\mu\right) \Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \\
& +t \sum_{j=1,2}\left(\bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \Psi_{\alpha}\left(\vec{r}+\vec{e}_{j}, t\right)+\bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \Psi_{\alpha}\left(\vec{r}-\vec{e}_{j}, t\right)+\text { c.c. }\right) \\
& +\frac{U}{6}\left(\bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} \Psi_{\beta}(\vec{r}, t)\right)^{2} \tag{3.104}
\end{align*}
$$

The associated path integral contains quartic terms, the interaction, and hence we do not know how to compute the partition function. The strategy is to write another theory, which is quadratic in Grassmann fields and is equivalent to Eq. (3.104). We will make extensive use of the Gaussian identity for bosonic fields (or HubbardStratonovich transformation)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int d \vec{\phi} e^{-i\left(\frac{1}{2} \vec{\phi}^{2}+\lambda \vec{\phi} \cdot \bar{\Psi} \vec{\tau} \Psi\right)}=\text { constant } \times e^{i \frac{1}{2} \lambda^{2}(\bar{\Psi} \vec{\tau} \Psi)^{2}} \tag{3.105}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus at any point in space time $(\vec{r}, t)$, we introduce a three-component real Bose field $\vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$ coupled bilinearly to the fermions as in Eq. (3.105). If one chooses the coupling constant $\lambda$ to be equal to $\sqrt{U / 3}$, one finds the interaction term of Eq. (3.100). Thus the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}^{\prime}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}^{\prime}= & \bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t)\left(i \partial_{t}+\mu\right) \Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \\
& +t \sum_{j=1,2}\left[\bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \Psi_{\alpha}\left(\vec{r}+\vec{e}_{j}, t\right)+\bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \Psi_{\alpha}\left(\vec{r}-\vec{e}_{j}, t\right)+\text { c.c. }\right] \\
& -\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}} \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot \bar{\Psi}_{\alpha}(\vec{r}, t) \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} \Psi_{\beta}(\vec{r}, t)-\frac{1}{2} \vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.106}
\end{align*}
$$

is equivalent to the Lagrangian of the Hubbard model. Equation (3.106) has the advantage of being bilinear in Fermi fields (compare Eqs. (3.106) and (3.3)). Thus, using Eq. (3.102), we can now integrate out the fermions. The result is an effective action for the Bose fields $\vec{\phi}$. We will see that the $\vec{\phi}$ fields represent the collective modes associated with spin fluctuations. The result is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z=\int \mathcal{D} \vec{\phi} e^{i S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})} \tag{3.107}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the effective action $S_{\text {eff }}(\vec{\phi})$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})=-\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{1}{2} \vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)-i \ln \operatorname{det}\left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})\right) \tag{3.108}
\end{equation*}
$$

The operator $\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})$ in Eq. (3.108) has the matrix elements

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})\left|\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} \beta\right\rangle= & -\delta_{\alpha \beta} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) t \sum_{j=1,2}\left(\delta_{\vec{r}^{\prime}, \vec{r}+\vec{e}_{j}}+\delta_{\vec{r}^{\prime}, \vec{r}-\vec{e}_{j}}\right) \\
& +\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} \tag{3.109}
\end{align*}
$$

The mean-field theory for this problem is just the evaluation of the path integral Eq. (3.107) by means of the saddle-point (or stationary-phase) approximation. For this problem, this approximation is equivalent to a Hartree-Fock decoupling. The stationary condition is

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\frac{\delta S_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\delta \phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)}=-\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)-i \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)} \ln \operatorname{det}\left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})\right) \tag{3.110}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the identity

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln \operatorname{det} A=\operatorname{tr} \ln A \tag{3.111}
\end{equation*}
$$

and Eq. (3.109), one finds

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t) & =-i \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)} \operatorname{tr}\left(\ln \left[i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})\right]\right) \\
& =+i \operatorname{tr}\left(\frac{1}{i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})} \frac{\delta M(\vec{\phi})}{\delta \phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)}\right) \\
& =i \sqrt{\frac{U}{3}\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \frac{1}{i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})}|\vec{r} t \beta\rangle \tau_{\beta \alpha}^{a}} \tag{3.112}
\end{align*}
$$

The expression in angular brackets is just the (in space and time diagonal) matrix element of the fermion one-particle Green function in a background field $\vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
G_{\alpha \beta}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \phi\right) \equiv-i\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \frac{1}{i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\phi)}\left|\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} \beta\right\rangle \tag{3.113}
\end{equation*}
$$

Hence we can write Eq. (3.112) in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)=-\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}} G_{\alpha \beta}(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r} t ; \phi) \tau_{\beta \alpha}^{a} \tag{3.114}
\end{equation*}
$$

On the other hand, the local magnetic moment $\left\langle S^{a}(\vec{r} t)\right\rangle$ is equal to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle S^{a}(\vec{r} t)\right\rangle=+G_{\alpha \beta}(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r} t ; \phi) \frac{\tau_{\beta \alpha}^{a}}{2} \tag{3.115}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the saddle-point approximation, Eq. (3.110), is the same as the Hartree-Fock condition

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)=-\sqrt{\frac{4 U}{3}}\left\langle S^{a}(\vec{r}, t)\right\rangle \tag{3.116}
\end{equation*}
$$

At the level of a one-band Hubbard model, there is no quantitative justification for the validity of this approach, since there is no small parameter other than $\hbar$ to control this expansion. Thus, this is essentially a semi-classical approximation.

We also know that an angular-momentum degree of freedom, such as spin itself, becomes semi-classical if the angular momentum becomes large. The main
assumption of the mean-field theory is that the order parameter thus obtained, in this case the staggered magnetization, is close to its saturation value and hence is large.

We can formally introduce a small parameter to control this expansion by means of the following device. Let us imagine that the band electrons have an orbital degeneracy labeled by an index $a=1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{b}}$, where $N_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the number of degenerate bands. The total band spin at a given site $\vec{r}$ is now given by $(i=1,2,3)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{i}(\vec{r})=\sum_{\alpha, \beta=\uparrow, \downarrow} \sum_{a=1}^{N_{\mathrm{b}}} \Psi_{\alpha, a}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) \tau_{\alpha \beta}^{i} \Psi_{\beta, a}(\vec{r}) \tag{3.117}
\end{equation*}
$$

The generalized Hubbard model is then given by the Hamiltonian

$$
\begin{equation*}
H=-\sum_{\substack{\left\langle\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right\rangle \\ \alpha, a}} \Psi_{\alpha, a}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}) t\left(\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}\right) \Psi_{\alpha, a}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}\right)+\text { c.c. }-\frac{2}{3} U \sum_{\vec{r}}(\vec{S}(\vec{r}))^{2} \tag{3.118}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{S}(\vec{r})$ is the total band spin at $\vec{r}$. This system still has the global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ invariance of spin rotations. For large values of $U$, i.e. $U / t \rightarrow \infty$, the local spin becomes as large as possible. The equivalent Heisenberg model has a total spin quantum number $s$ at each site equal to $s=N_{\mathrm{b}} / 2$ or, equivalently, $N_{\mathrm{b}}=2 s$. The limit $N_{\mathrm{b}} \rightarrow \infty$ is then the same as the semi-classical limit $s \rightarrow \infty$. This limit is usually treated by spin-wave theory (Bloch, 1930; Holstein and Primakoff, 1940; Dyson, 1956a, b; Maleev, 1957) (for a review see the book by Mattis (1965)).

The path-integral approach is particularly well suited to deal with this limit. As a matter of fact, all the formulas derived above carry over to this case. The HubbardStratonovich transformation works, with the only change being that $\vec{\phi}$ couples now to the total band spin. Since all $N_{\mathrm{b}}$ orbital species couple exactly in the same way to the Hubbard-Stratonovich field $\vec{\phi}$, the only change that occurs is that the fermion determinant factorizes and is given by the $N_{\mathrm{b}}$ th power of the determinant of a single species. After a trivial rescaling of the field $\vec{\phi}$ by $\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{b}}}$, the effective action $S_{\text {eff }}^{N_{\mathrm{b}}}$ for the theory with orbital degeneracy is simply given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}^{N_{\mathrm{b}}}(\vec{\phi})=N_{\mathrm{b}} S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi}) \tag{3.119}
\end{equation*}
$$

In the large- $N_{\mathrm{b}}$ limit (i.e. large- $s$ limit), the saddle-point approximation becomes exact. For the rest of this section, we will carry on with this expansion assuming that it is valid. We should keep in mind, however, that the results will become accurate only in the $s \rightarrow \infty$ limit.

It is apparent that if $\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)$ is a solution, any uniform rotation of it is also a solution,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{a}^{\prime}=R_{a b} \phi_{b} \tag{3.120}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $R_{a b}$ is a constant rotation matrix. This implies that the global spin symmetry has been preserved. We will see now that this implies the existence of Goldstone modes, spin waves, if this symmetry is spontaneously broken.

Let us consider the half-filled case. Here, we expect an antiferromagnetic state. The classical solution is (for the case of a square lattice)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t)=|\vec{\phi}| n^{a}(-1)^{x_{1}+x_{2}} \tag{3.121}
\end{equation*}
$$

This solution is (a) static, and (b) staggered (i.e. a Néel state). It really represents an infinite number of solutions parametrized by the unit vector $\vec{n}$ (in spin space). The amplitude $|\vec{\phi}|$ is determined by solving the saddle-point equation, Eq. (3.116). In the notation of Eq. (3.113), we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{M}=\sqrt{\frac{4 U}{3}} \vec{\phi} \tag{3.122}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Section 3.1 we determined that the Néel state was energetically preferred both to a paramagnetic state and to a ferromagnetic state. Notice that this argument does not rule out other solutions. However, the existing numerical evidence seems to indicate that a Néel state is the ground state at half-filling except for one-dimensional systems.

In Section 3.1 we showed that (a) the amplitude $|\vec{\phi}|$ is always non-zero at zero temperature and (b) the single-particle excitation spectrum has a gap $\Delta=\left|\vec{M}_{0}\right|$. This last result can be seen to follow by computing the one-particle Green function $G_{\alpha \beta}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \phi\right)$ and writing it as a $4 \times 4$ matrix in spin and sublattice space.

Equation (3.113) is equivalent to

$$
\begin{align*}
-i \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \delta_{\alpha \beta}= & \left(i \partial_{t}+\mu\right) G_{\alpha \beta}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}\right) \\
& +t \sum_{j=1,2}\left[G_{\alpha \beta}\left(\vec{r}+\vec{e}_{j} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}\right)+G_{\alpha \beta}\left(\vec{r}-\vec{e}_{j} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}\right)\right] \\
& -\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \gamma}(-1)^{x_{1}+x_{2}} G_{\gamma \beta}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}\right) \tag{3.123}
\end{align*}
$$

If we Fourier transform Eq. (3.123), we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
-i \delta_{\alpha \beta}=(\omega-\epsilon(\vec{k})) G_{\alpha \beta}(\vec{k}, \omega)-\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \gamma} G_{\gamma \beta}(\vec{k}-\vec{Q}, \omega) \tag{3.124}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$ is the ordering wave vector (for the Néel state, the corner of the first Brillouin zone). This equation can be solved by writing (the Fourier transform of) the fermion operators in a spinor notation $\Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ defined by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{k}, \omega) \equiv\binom{\Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{k}, \omega)}{\Psi_{\alpha}(\vec{k}-\vec{Q}, \omega)} \tag{3.125}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{k} \in \mathrm{BZ}^{+}$(the upper half of the first Brillouin zone). Equation (3.124) now takes the matrix form

$$
-i \delta_{\alpha \beta}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
(\omega-\epsilon(\vec{k})) \delta_{\alpha \gamma} & -\sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \gamma}  \tag{3.126}\\
-\sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \gamma} & (\omega+\epsilon(\vec{k})) \delta_{\alpha \gamma}
\end{array}\right) \mathcal{G}_{\gamma \beta}(\vec{k}, \omega)
$$

The solution of this equation is

$$
\mathcal{G}(\vec{k}, \omega)=\frac{-i}{\omega^{2}-\left(\epsilon^{2}(\vec{k})+(U / 3)|\vec{\phi}|^{2}\right)+i \eta}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
(\omega+\epsilon(\vec{k})) & \sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau}  \tag{3.127}\\
\sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}| \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\tau} & (\omega-\epsilon(\vec{k}))
\end{array}\right)
$$

with $\eta \rightarrow 0^{+}$. Here, the diagonal components correspond to the Fourier transform of the Green function for sites on the same sublattice, and the off-diagonal terms correspond to sites on different sublattices.

This solution clearly shows that the single-particle fermionic spectrum for the Néel state is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E(\vec{k})=\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}(\vec{k})+\frac{U}{3}|\vec{\phi}|^{2}}=\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}(\vec{k})+\Delta^{2}} \tag{3.128}
\end{equation*}
$$

and we recover Eq. (3.42), with an energy gap $\Delta=\sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}|$.

### 3.4 Fluctuations: the non-linear sigma model

In the previous section we obtained an effective action for the order-parameter field $\vec{\phi}$ and solved the saddle-point equations. We now wish to estimate the role and size of the quantum-mechanical fluctuations about this classical Néel state.

When solving the saddle-point equations, we observed that, if a non-trivial solution $\vec{\phi}_{c}$ with broken symmetry can be found, then any configuration obtained by means of a rigid rotation in spin space from $\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is also a solution. This reflects the fact that the spin sector has a continuous symmetry group, in this case $\mathrm{O}(3)$.

Imagine now not a solution of the saddle-point equation but a slowly varying configuration $\vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$ not far from a solution. The fluctuation part $\delta \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$ is small and slowly varying. By slowly varying, I mean slow on time scales compared with $\tau=1 / \Delta$ and smooth on length scales long compared with $\xi=v_{\mathrm{F}} / \Delta$ (where $v_{\mathrm{F}}$ is the Fermi velocity of the unperturbed system). This last length $\xi$ is the (mean-field) correlation length of the system. It will turn out that $\xi$ and $\tau$ determine the scales on which the magnitude $|\vec{\phi}|$ of the order parameter fluctuates, at least in mean-field theory.

The existence of an infinite number of solutions of the saddle-point equation indicates that there are configurations $\delta \vec{\phi}$ with arbitrarily low action. These are the

Goldstone bosons of this problem and are spin waves. We wish to find an effective theory for these spin waves.

Our first step will be to study the (Gaussian) fluctuations around the mean-field solution. Thus, we will expand the effective action $S_{\text {eff }}(\phi)$ in powers of $\delta \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$. Since $\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})$ of Eq. (3.109) is linear in $\vec{\phi}$, we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})=\mathcal{M}\left(\vec{\phi}_{c}\right)+\mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi}) \tag{3.129}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the matrix elements of $\mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})$ are

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})\left|\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} \alpha^{\prime}\right\rangle=\sqrt{\frac{U}{3}} \delta \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \alpha^{\prime}} \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \tag{3.130}
\end{equation*}
$$

By expanding in powers of $\mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})$, we find that the effective action

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})=-\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}(\vec{\phi})\right) \tag{3.131}
\end{equation*}
$$

can be written in the form

$$
\begin{align*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})= & -\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)\right) \\
& -i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(1-i \mathcal{G}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})\right) \tag{3.132}
\end{align*}
$$

with the mean field Green function $\mathcal{G}\left(\vec{\phi}_{c}\right)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{G}_{\alpha \alpha^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)=-i\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \frac{1}{i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}\left|\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} \alpha^{\prime}\right\rangle \tag{3.133}
\end{equation*}
$$

Recall that the Green function $\mathcal{G}$ has a matrix structure involving both sublattices of the Néel state, cf. Eq. (3.127).

Since the Néel state breaks translation invariance by one lattice spacing (i.e. it breaks the sublattice symmetry of the square lattice), the Green function also breaks translation invariance and it is invariant only under shifts on the same sublattice. For the same reason the fluctuations $\delta \phi(\vec{r}, t)$ on the two sublattices behave differently. Hence we will also represent $\delta \phi(\vec{r}, t)$ by a two-component object denoting the two sublattices.

By expanding the logarithm in powers of the fluctuations $\delta \vec{\phi}$, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})= & -\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)\right) \\
& +\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{i^{n+1}}{n} \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathcal{G}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})\right)^{n} \tag{3.134}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (3.134) can be organized as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} S^{(n)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}, \delta \vec{\phi}\right) \tag{3.135}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ is the classical action (i.e. the action of the mean-field solution)

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)=-\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left[i \partial_{t}+\mu-\mathcal{M}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)\right] \tag{3.136}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the mean-field solution is static (i.e. time-independent), we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)=T E_{\text {Gnd }}^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \tag{3.137}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $T$ is the time span (not the temperature!) and $E_{\mathrm{Gnd}}^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ is the ground-state energy (at the level of the mean-field theory). The first-order term in $\delta \vec{\phi}$ cancels out since $\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a solution of the saddle-point equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\delta S_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\delta \vec{\phi}}=0 \tag{3.138}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus we can write $S_{\text {eff }}$ in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi})=T E_{\mathrm{Gnd}}^{(0)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} S^{(n)}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}, \delta \vec{\phi}\right) \tag{3.139}
\end{equation*}
$$

The Gaussian theory, i.e. the quadratic terms in Eq. (3.139), has the action $S^{(2)}(\delta \vec{\phi})$, where

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{(2)}(\delta \vec{\phi})=-\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\delta \vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-\frac{i}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathcal{G}\left(\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \mathcal{M}(\delta \vec{\phi})\right)^{2} \tag{3.140}
\end{equation*}
$$

This expression can be expanded out in components to yield

$$
\begin{align*}
S^{(2)}(\delta \vec{\phi})= & -\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\delta \vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2} \\
& -i \frac{U}{6} \int d t d t^{\prime} \sum_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \mathcal{G}_{\alpha, \alpha^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r} t ; \vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \tau_{\alpha^{\prime} \beta}^{a^{\prime} \mathcal{G}_{\beta \beta^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} ; \vec{r} t ; \vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \tau_{\beta^{\prime} \alpha}^{a}} \\
& \times \delta \phi^{a^{\prime}}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right) \delta \phi^{a}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.141}
\end{align*}
$$

We will see now that fluctuations $\delta \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$ with wave vector $\vec{p}$ close to the antiferromagnetic (Néel) ordering wave vector $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$ are gapless, i.e. have vanishingly small energy. These are the antiferromagnetic spin waves. Conversely, the excitations with $\vec{p}$ close to the zone center ( $\vec{p} \approx 0$ ), which describe uniform ferromagnetic fluctuations, have large energies. Formally this amounts
to splitting the fluctuations into a ferromagnetic component $\delta \phi_{\mathrm{F}}$, whose Fourier transform has wave vectors close to ( 0,0 ), and an antiferromagnetic component $\delta \phi_{\mathrm{AF}}$, whose Fourier components have wave vectors close to the ordering wave vector $\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$. From now on we will consider only the antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which we will denote by $\delta \phi_{\mathrm{AF}}=\delta \phi$.

In Fourier components, the effective action for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations $\delta \phi$ has the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{(2)}(\delta \vec{\phi})=\int_{\vec{p}, \Omega} \frac{1}{2} \delta \phi_{a}(\vec{p}, \Omega) \delta \phi_{b}^{*}(\vec{p}, \Omega) K^{a b}(\vec{p}, \Omega) \tag{3.142}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the kernel $K^{a b}(\vec{p}, \Omega)$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
K^{a b}(\vec{p}, \Omega)=-\delta^{a b}-i \frac{U}{3} \int_{\vec{k}, \omega} \operatorname{tr}\left(\mathcal{G}(\vec{k}, \omega) \tau^{a} T \mathcal{G}(\vec{k}+\vec{p}, \omega+\Omega) \tau^{b} T\right) \tag{3.143}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{G}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ is given by Eq. (3.127) and $T$ is the $2 \times 2$ matrix

$$
T=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0  \tag{3.144}\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

The following trace identities for the Pauli matrices will be useful to compute the kernel:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \operatorname{tr} 1=2, \quad \operatorname{tr} \tau^{a}=0, \quad \operatorname{tr}\left(\tau^{a} \tau^{b}\right)=2 \delta^{a b}, \quad \operatorname{tr}\left(\tau^{a} \tau^{b} \tau^{c}\right)=2 i \epsilon^{a b c}, \\
& \operatorname{tr}\left(\tau^{a} \tau^{b} \tau^{c} \tau^{d}\right)=2\left(\delta^{a b} \delta^{c d}-\delta^{a c} \delta^{b d}+\delta^{a d} \delta^{b c}\right) \tag{3.145}
\end{align*}
$$

We can now write the kernel $K^{a b}(\vec{p}, \Omega)$ in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
K^{a b}(\vec{p}, \Omega)=K_{0}(\vec{p}, \Omega) \delta^{a b}+K_{2}(\vec{p}, \Omega) n^{a} n^{b} \tag{3.146}
\end{equation*}
$$

after inserting Eq. (3.127) into Eq. (3.143) and using the trace identities. One obtains for $K_{0}$ and $K_{2}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& K_{0}(\vec{p}, \Omega)=-1+i \frac{4 U}{3} \int_{\vec{k}, \omega} \frac{\omega(\omega+\Omega)+\epsilon(\vec{k}) \epsilon(\vec{k}+\vec{p})-\Delta^{2}}{\left(\omega^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k})+i \eta\right)\left((\omega+\Omega)^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k}+\vec{p})+i \eta\right)} \\
& K_{2}(\vec{p}, \Omega)=+i \frac{8 U}{3} \Delta^{2} \int_{\vec{k}, \omega} \frac{1}{\left(\omega^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k})+i \eta\right)\left((\omega+\Omega)^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k}+\vec{p})+i \eta\right)} \tag{3.147}
\end{align*}
$$

where the integrals range over the full Brillouin zone and $\Delta=\sqrt{U / 3}|\vec{\phi}|$ (see Eq. (3.128)). The structure of the effective kernel, Eqs. (3.147), is a consequence of the symmetry of the spectrum, which, in turn, reflects the fact that the Néel state is invariant under the combined effects of time reversal and displacement by
one lattice spacing, which amounts to the exchange of the two antiferromagnetic sublattices.

We are interested in studying the low-energy limit $(\Omega \Delta \ll 1)$ of this system. It will be convenient to decompose the fluctuations $\delta \vec{\phi}(\vec{p}, \Omega)$ into a longitudinal component $\sigma(\vec{p}, \Omega)$ parallel to $\vec{n}$ and two transverse components $\pi_{i}(\vec{p}, \Omega)$ perpendicular to $\vec{n}$. In terms of $\sigma$ and $\vec{\pi}$, the Gaussian action $S^{(2)}$, Eq. (3.142), has the form

$$
\begin{align*}
S^{(2)}(\delta \vec{\phi})=\int_{\vec{p}, \Omega}\{ & \left(K_{0}(\vec{p}, \Omega)+K_{2}(\vec{p}, \Omega)\right)|\sigma(\vec{p}, \Omega)|^{2} \\
& \left.+K_{0}(\vec{p}, \Omega) \vec{\pi}(\vec{p}, \Omega) \cdot \vec{\pi}^{*}(\vec{p}, \Omega)\right\} \tag{3.148}
\end{align*}
$$

I will now show that for wave vectors $\vec{p}$ close to the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}=$ $(\pi, \pi)$, the transverse components (represented by the fields $\vec{\pi}$ ) become gapless. In contrast, the longitudinal component, $\sigma$, remains massive (i.e. with a non-zero gap) over the entire Brillouin zone. Thus, in a Néel state, the Hubbard model has two gapless transverse spin waves $\vec{\pi}$ and a massive (gapped) longitudinal amplitude mode $\sigma$.

We can check this statement by considering the limit $\Omega \rightarrow 0$ and $\vec{p}=\vec{Q}-\vec{q}$ where $|\vec{q}|$ is small, i.e. $|\vec{q}| \xi \ll 1$. Thus, the relevant limit is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Omega \Delta \ll 1, \quad|\vec{q}| \frac{v_{\mathrm{F}}}{\Delta} \ll 1 \tag{3.149}
\end{equation*}
$$

We wish to expand the kernels of Eq. (3.147) in powers of $\vec{q}$ and $\Omega$, i.e. we are performing a gradient expansion.

Let us first compute $K_{0}$ and $K_{2}$ for $\Omega=0$ and $\vec{p}=\vec{Q}$. The result, for $K_{0}(\vec{Q}, 0)$, is zero:

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{0}(\vec{Q}, 0)=-1+i \frac{4 U}{3} \int_{\vec{k}, \omega} \frac{1}{\omega^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k})+i \eta} \equiv 0 \tag{3.150}
\end{equation*}
$$

This result follows from the saddle-point (gap) equation, Eq. (3.114) (or, equivalently, Eq. (3.47)). Similarly, the other kernel $K_{2}$ has the limit, after integrating over $\omega$,

$$
\begin{align*}
K_{2}(\vec{Q}, 0) & =i \frac{8 U}{3} \Delta^{2} \int_{\vec{k}} \int \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{1}{\left(\omega^{2}-E^{2}(\vec{k})+i \eta\right)^{2}} \\
& =-\frac{2 U}{3} \Delta^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \epsilon \frac{\rho(\epsilon)}{\left(\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \\
& \simeq-\frac{1}{12 \pi^{2}}\left(\frac{2 U}{t}\right) \ln \left(\frac{2 t}{\Delta}\right) \tag{3.151}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is the one-particle density of states of Eq. (3.49) and Eq. (3.50).

Figure 3.5 A spin-wave spectrum along the main diagonal of the Brillouin zone.

These results imply that the longitudinal $\sigma$ mode for $\vec{p} \approx \vec{Q}$ and $\Omega \rightarrow 0$ has a finite mass (or energy gap), and imply the absence of such a mass term for both transverse $\vec{\pi}$ modes (see Fig. 3.5). The mass of the $\sigma$ mode can be used to define a spin-correlation length $\xi_{\text {spin }}$. (We should note, however, that in two space dimensions the $\sigma$ mode has a finite lifetime since it can decay into two $\vec{\pi}$ modes.)

We can also estimate the spin-wave stiffness from these results. However, we need to keep the leading order in both $\Omega$ and $\vec{q}$ to get these results. By expanding in powers of both $\Omega \ll \Delta$ and $\vec{q}$ (with $|\vec{q}| \ll|\vec{Q}|)$, we find for $K_{0}(\vec{Q}-\vec{q}, \Omega)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{0}(\vec{Q}-\vec{q}, \Omega)=a \Omega^{2}-b \vec{q}^{2}+\text { h.o.t. } \tag{3.152}
\end{equation*}
$$

The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are most easily found by doing first an analytic continuation of the frequency integration, $\omega \rightarrow i \omega$, together with an analytic continuation of the external frequency, $\Omega \rightarrow i \Omega$; at the end of the calculation we must analytically continue back to the real frequency axis. We obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
a & =\lim _{\Omega \rightarrow 0} \frac{K_{0}(\vec{Q}, i \Omega)}{-\Omega^{2}}=\frac{2 U}{3} \int_{\mathrm{BZ}} \frac{d^{2} k}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{1}{E^{3}(\vec{k})} \\
& =\frac{2 U}{3} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \epsilon \frac{\rho(\epsilon)}{\left(\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \simeq \frac{U}{3 \Delta^{2}} \rho(\Delta) \tag{3.153}
\end{align*}
$$

where the last expression follows in the weak-coupling limit, $U \ll t$, where $\Delta$ is small. Similarly, we also obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
b & =\lim _{\vec{p} \rightarrow 0} \frac{K_{0}(\vec{Q}-\vec{p}, 0)}{\vec{p}^{2}} \\
& =\frac{U}{3} \lim _{\vec{p} \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\vec{p}^{2}} \int_{\mathrm{BZ}} \frac{d^{2} k}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{\epsilon(\vec{k})(\epsilon(\vec{k}+\vec{p})-\epsilon(\vec{k}))}{E(\vec{k}) E(\vec{p})(E(\vec{k}+\vec{p})+E(\vec{k}))} \\
& =\frac{U}{24} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \epsilon \rho(\epsilon)\left[\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}}+\frac{6 t \epsilon}{\left(\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}\left(1-\frac{\epsilon^{2}}{4 t^{2}}\right)\right] \simeq \frac{U}{16} \frac{D}{\Delta} \rho(\Delta) \tag{3.154}
\end{align*}
$$

where we have used that the band width is $2 D=8 t$. In Eqs. (3.153) and (3.154), $\rho(\Delta)$ is the density of states of the free-fermion problem at the energy $\Delta$.

Thus, the transverse $\vec{\pi}$ modes have the effective action for fluctuations with momenta close to the ordering wave vector $\vec{Q}$ and frequencies low with respect to the gap $\Delta$ of

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\vec{\pi}}^{(2)}=\frac{1}{2} \int_{\vec{q}, \Omega} \rho_{\mathrm{s}}\left(\frac{1}{v_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}} \Omega^{2}-\vec{q}^{2}\right)|\vec{\pi}(\vec{q}, \Omega)|^{2} \tag{3.155}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have defined $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$, the spin-wave stiffness, and $v_{\mathrm{s}}$, the spin-wave velocity, respectively, by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{\mathrm{s}}=b \simeq \frac{U}{16} \frac{D}{\Delta} \rho(\Delta), \quad v_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}=\frac{b}{a} \simeq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \sqrt{D \Delta} \tag{3.156}
\end{equation*}
$$

These results show that the transverse $\vec{\pi}$ modes are massless and have a linear dispersion relation

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Omega=v_{\mathrm{s}}|\vec{q}| \tag{3.157}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.5 The Néel state and the non-linear sigma model

I will now show that these results can be embodied in a very simple effective Lagrangian that includes all the relevant non-linear effects. The key to the argument is the observation that the Néel state breaks, on each sublattice, the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry. This is a continuous symmetry. The transverse spin waves are gapless excitations because they involve merely tilting the spins relative to the classical mean-field state. But they do not change the amplitude of the field. Thus, it is natural to ask for the effective Lagrangian in which the amplitude fluctuations are frozen but the transverse ones are not. In mathematical terms this means that, in position space, the staggered order parameter $\vec{n}(\vec{r}, t)$ will be slowly varying and its length will be constrained to be equal to a fixed value $\left|\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right|$, the classical minimum. Thus, the fields $\sigma(\vec{k}, \omega)$ and $\vec{\pi}(\vec{k}, \omega)$ need to be scaled by a factor of $\left|\vec{\phi}_{c}\right|^{-1}$. The net effect is that the spin-wave stiffness $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$, Eq. (3.155), gets multiplied by $\left|\vec{\phi}_{\mathrm{c}}\right|^{2}$, the solution of Eq. (3.110).

This calculation can in fact be carried out because the transverse spin waves remain massless to all orders in an expansion around the mean-field solution. This is guaranteed by a Ward identity, which is a consequence of the symmetry. We shall derive this identity below.

Let us consider the Hubbard model coupled to an external magnetic field $\vec{H}(\vec{r}, t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
H_{\text {Zeeman }}=\sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{H}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\vec{r}, t) \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} c_{\beta}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.158}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we retrace the steps that led to the path integral for the Hubbard-Stratonovich field $\vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)$, we find a new effective action of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_{\mathrm{eff}}(\vec{\phi}, \vec{H})=-\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{\phi}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2}-i \operatorname{tr} \ln \left(i \partial_{t}+\mu-M(\vec{\phi})-\vec{H}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot \vec{\tau}\right) \tag{3.159}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the magnetic field $\vec{H}(\vec{r}, t)$ is a c-number operator with matrix elements

$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle\vec{r} t \alpha| \vec{H}(\vec{r}, t)\left|\vec{r}^{\prime} t^{\prime} \alpha^{\prime}\right\rangle=\delta_{\alpha, \alpha^{\prime}} \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \vec{H}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.160}
\end{equation*}
$$

In principle, we will want to study the Néel state. Hence we will choose $\vec{H}(\vec{r}, t)$ to be staggered and time-independent, i.e.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{H}_{\mathrm{s}}(\vec{r}, t)=\vec{H}_{\mathrm{s}} e^{i \vec{Q} \cdot \vec{r}} \tag{3.161}
\end{equation*}
$$

with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{Q}=(\pi, \pi) \tag{3.162}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can prove the existence of gapless excitations, to all orders in perturbation theory, by deriving a Ward identity. This identity can be derived by standard methods (Amit, 1980). Let us first shift the $\vec{\phi}$ field

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{\phi}^{\prime}(\vec{r}, t) \equiv \vec{\phi}(\vec{r}, t)+\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \vec{H}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.163}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can write

$$
\begin{align*}
S_{\text {eff }}(\vec{\phi}, \vec{H})= & S_{\text {eff }}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime}, 0\right)+\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \vec{\phi}^{\prime}(\vec{r}, t) \cdot \vec{H}(\vec{r}, t) \\
& -\frac{3}{U} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{H}^{2}(\vec{r}, t)}{2} \tag{3.164}
\end{align*}
$$

Next, we can make use of the invariance of the integration measure $\mathcal{D} \vec{\phi}$ under the rotation $\phi_{a}^{\prime \prime}=R_{a b} \phi_{b}^{\prime}$ (where $R_{a b}$ is a rotation matrix), $\mathcal{D} \phi^{\prime \prime}=\mathcal{D} \phi^{\prime}$, to shift the
coordinates of the functional integral. The rotation matrix $R_{a b}$ can be written in terms of Euler angles $\theta^{c}$ and rotation generators $L^{c}$ in the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{a b}=\left(e^{-i L^{c} \theta^{c}}\right)_{a b} \tag{3.165}
\end{equation*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(L^{c}\right)_{a b}=-i \epsilon_{a b c} \tag{3.166}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, for an infinitesimal rotation $\left(\theta^{c} \ll 1\right)$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{a}^{\prime \prime}=\phi_{a}^{\prime}-\epsilon_{a b c} \phi_{b}^{\prime} \theta_{c} \tag{3.167}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the invariance of the measure, we can now write for the vacuum persistence amplitude in the presence of the "source" $\vec{H}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& Z[\vec{H}] \equiv \exp \left(i F[\vec{H}]-i \frac{3}{U} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\vec{H}^{2}}{2}\right) \\
&=\int \mathcal{D} \vec{\phi}^{\prime} \exp \left[i S_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime}, 0\right)+i \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \vec{\phi}^{\prime} \cdot \vec{H}-\frac{3}{2 U} \vec{H}^{2}\right)\right] \\
&=\int \mathcal{D} \vec{\phi}^{\prime \prime} \exp \left[i S_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime \prime}, 0\right)+i \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \vec{\phi}^{\prime \prime} \cdot \vec{H}-\frac{3}{2 U} \vec{H}^{2}\right)\right] \\
&=\int \mathcal{D} \vec{\phi}^{\prime} \exp \left[i S_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime}, 0\right)+i \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \vec{\phi}^{\prime} \cdot \vec{H}-\frac{3}{2 U} \vec{H}^{2}\right)\right. \\
&\left.\quad+i \delta S_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime}, \vec{H}, \vec{\theta}\right)\right] \tag{3.168}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\delta S_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\vec{\phi}^{\prime}, \vec{H}, \vec{\theta}\right)=-\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \epsilon^{a b c} H^{a}(\vec{r}, t) \phi^{\prime b}(\vec{r}, t) \theta^{c} \tag{3.169}
\end{equation*}
$$

By expanding Eq. (3.168) in powers of $\theta$ we obtain, to leading order,

$$
\begin{equation*}
Z[\vec{H}]=Z[\vec{H}]\left(1+\delta \bar{S}_{\mathrm{eff}}+\cdots\right) \tag{3.170}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, since the variables $\theta^{c}$ are arbitrary, we obtain the identity

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \epsilon^{a b c} H^{a}(\vec{r}, t) \bar{\phi}^{\prime b}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.171}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here $\bar{\phi}^{\prime b}$ is the exact expectation value of $\phi^{\prime b}$ in the presence of $\vec{H}$.

Let us define now the generating functional of vertex functions, $\Gamma\left[\bar{\phi}^{\prime}\right]$, by means of the Legendre transform

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma\left[\bar{\phi}^{\prime}\right]=\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \bar{\phi}_{a}^{\prime}(\vec{r}, t) H_{a}(\vec{r}, t)-F[\vec{H}] \tag{3.172}
\end{equation*}
$$

with

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta H^{b}(\vec{r}, t)}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} \bar{\phi}^{\prime b}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.173}
\end{equation*}
$$

It follows (Amit, 1980) that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\delta \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(\vec{r}, t)}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} H^{a}(\vec{r}, t) \tag{3.174}
\end{equation*}
$$

The one-particle irreducible vertex functions can be defined in terms of functional derivatives of $\Gamma$ relative to $\bar{\phi}_{d}^{\prime}$. For instance, the two-point irreducible function

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_{a b}^{(2)}\left(\vec{r}, t, \vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right) \equiv \frac{\delta^{2} \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}_{a}^{\prime}(\vec{r}, t) \delta \bar{\phi}_{b}^{\prime}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)} \tag{3.175}
\end{equation*}
$$

is the inverse of the $\vec{\phi}^{\prime}$ two-point (Green) function

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\vec{r}^{\prime}, b} \frac{\delta^{2} \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(\vec{r}, t) \delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime b}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)} \frac{\delta^{2} F}{\delta H^{b}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right) \delta H^{c}\left(\vec{r}^{\prime \prime}, t^{\prime \prime}\right)}=\delta_{a c} \delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime \prime}} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime \prime}\right) \tag{3.176}
\end{equation*}
$$

With those definitions, Eq. (3.171) can be brought to the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}}\left(\epsilon^{a b c} \frac{\delta \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(\vec{r}, t)} \bar{\phi}^{\prime b}(\vec{r}, t)\right) \tag{3.177}
\end{equation*}
$$

To avoid cumbersome notation we denote from now on $(\vec{r}, t) \equiv\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{0}\right) \equiv x$, and $\delta_{\vec{r}, \vec{r}^{\prime}} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \equiv \delta\left(x-x^{\prime}\right)$. By taking a further derivative with respect to $\bar{\phi}^{\prime d}\left(x^{\prime}\right)$, one gets the general Ward identity

$$
\begin{equation*}
0=\int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \epsilon^{a b c}\left(\frac{\delta^{2} \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime d}\left(x^{\prime}\right) \delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(x)} \bar{\phi}^{\prime b}(x)+\frac{\delta \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(x)} \delta^{b d} \delta\left(x-x^{\prime}\right)\right) \tag{3.178}
\end{equation*}
$$

In particular, for the Néel state

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\phi}^{\prime b}(x)=|\vec{\phi}| n^{b}(-1)^{x_{1}+x_{2}} \tag{3.179}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the corresponding staggered field of Eq. (3.161), we get the Ward identity

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^{a d c} \sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} H_{\mathrm{s}}^{a}\left(x^{\prime}\right)=-\epsilon^{a b c}|\vec{\phi}| n^{b} \int d t \sum_{\vec{r}} \frac{\delta^{2} \Gamma}{\delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime d}\left(x^{\prime}\right) \delta \bar{\phi}^{\prime a}(x)}(-1)^{x_{1}+x_{2}} \tag{3.180}
\end{equation*}
$$

In momentum space, Eq. (3.180) simply becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^{a c d} \sqrt{\frac{3}{U}} H_{\mathrm{s}}^{a}(\vec{Q})=\lim _{\substack{\omega \rightarrow 0 \\ \vec{p} \rightarrow 0}} \epsilon^{a b c}|\vec{\phi}| n^{b} \Gamma_{d a}^{(2)}(\vec{Q}+\vec{p}, \omega) \tag{3.181}
\end{equation*}
$$

The spontaneous breaking of symmetry means that, when the external field is switched off, the order parameter remains finite. In this case, for the right-hand side of Eq. (3.181) to vanish, the contraction of the vertex two-point function with the Levi-Civita tensor and with $\vec{n}$ must vanish in this limit. Thus, if $|\vec{\phi}| \neq 0$, the transverse components of $\vec{\phi}$ must have a pole at $\omega=0$ and $\vec{p}=\vec{Q}$ in their correlation function (see Eq. (3.175)). We found before that this was indeed the case in the leading order of an expansion around mean-field theory.

Since we know now that this leading-order pole must persist to all orders, we can look for an effective Lagrangian with the following properties:
(1) the amplitude fluctuations are suppressed,
(2) it has a massless pole for each transverse component, and
(3) it has a minimum number of derivatives in the order-parameter field.

The simplest expression satisfying these properties is the non-linear sigma model with a Lagrangian density given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\text {eff }}=\frac{\rho}{2}\left(\left(\partial_{t} \vec{n}\right)^{2}-v_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}(\nabla \vec{n})^{2}\right)+\cdots \tag{3.182}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vec{n}$ satisfies the constraint

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\vec{n}|^{2}=1 \tag{3.183}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here $\vec{n}$ represents the slow fluctuations of the order-parameter field. The spin-wave stiffness $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ and velocity $v_{\mathrm{s}}$ appearing in Eq. (3.182) are not generally identical to the values we calculated above (see Eq. (3.156)). The reason for that is that the nonlinear $\sigma$-model is the effective theory at low frequencies and for wave vectors close to $\vec{Q}$. It is the result of integrating out all fluctuations at high energies. This process significantly renormalizes the values of $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}$. In addition, I have ignored the possible existence of topological terms. We will see in Chapter 7 that these terms are generated in one dimension, but not in two or higher dimensions.

It is a simple matter to see that, if one solves for the constraint $|\vec{n}|=1$ in terms of a $\sigma$ and a $\vec{\pi}$ field

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vec{n}=\binom{\sigma}{\vec{\pi}} \tag{3.184}
\end{equation*}
$$

and expands in powers of $\vec{\pi}$, one finds, to the leading quadratic order in $\vec{\pi}$, the effective action Eq. (3.155).

We conclude that the quantum fluctuations around a Néel state are described by a non-linear $\sigma$-model. One key assumption that we have made here is that the stiffness $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ was assumed to be large. Otherwise this expansion does not make sense. In fact for $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ sufficiently small, the non-linear $\sigma$-model has wild fluctuations which destroy the Néel state. The system becomes a (quantum) paramagnet and the spin symmetry is unbroken. We will see below that frustrating interactions will generally produce this effect. On the other hand, given the large renormalizations of $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}$, it is not possible to be sure whether the half-filled Hubbard model is in a Néel state (i.e. whether the ground state is an antiferromagnet) or in a disordered state. In practice only numerical calculations, i.e. fermion Monte Carlo or finitesize exact diagonalizations, can yield more reliable answers for a specific Hubbard model. So far the evidence strongly favors a Néel state.

Finally we should consider the connection between the collective excitations $\vec{\phi}(\vec{x}, t)$ and the susceptibilities of the Hubbard model. From Eq. (3.158) we see that the field $\vec{H}(x)$ couples to the local moment $c_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(x) \vec{\tau}_{\alpha \beta} c_{\beta}(x)$. Thus by functionally differentiating with respect to $\vec{H}(x)$ we should be able to compute expectation values related to the spin degrees of freedom. Indeed, the spin correlation function

$$
\begin{equation*}
K^{a a^{\prime}}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)=\langle\mathrm{Gnd}| \hat{T} S^{a}\left(x^{\prime}\right) S^{a^{\prime}}\left(x^{\prime}\right)|\mathrm{Gnd}\rangle \tag{3.185}
\end{equation*}
$$

is equivalent to

$$
\begin{equation*}
K^{a a^{\prime}}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)=-g\left(x, x^{\prime}\right) \frac{\delta^{2} F}{\delta H_{s}^{a}(x) \delta H_{s}^{a^{\prime}}\left(x^{\prime}\right)} \equiv G_{a a^{\prime}}^{(2)}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right) \tag{3.186}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $g\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)$ is a sign function

$$
\begin{equation*}
g\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)=(-1)^{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{1}^{\prime}+x_{2}^{\prime}} \tag{3.187}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $G_{a a^{\prime}}^{(2)}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)$ is the inverse of $\Gamma_{a a^{\prime}}^{(2)}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)$, we conclude that a zero in $\Gamma_{a a^{\prime}}^{(2)}(\vec{p}, \omega)$ at $(\vec{Q}, 0)$ implies a divergence of $G_{a a^{\prime}}^{(2)}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)$ also at $(\vec{Q}, 0)$. Thus the staggered static susceptibility $\chi_{\perp}(\vec{Q}, 0)$, which is the Fourier transform of $K_{a a^{\prime}}\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)$, must have a delta-function peak at $(\vec{Q}, 0)$ if the ground state is a Néel state $(\vec{Q}, 0)$. This peak appears only in the transverse components of $K_{a a^{\prime}}$ since the longitudinal components are connected to excitations with a non-zero gap.
